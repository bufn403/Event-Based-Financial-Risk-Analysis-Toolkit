8,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2024-03-01,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Financial Performance or General Economic ConditionsEconomic downturns, uncertain economic conditions, and capital market fluctuations may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recessionary conditions, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, availability of credit, and interest rates could materially adversely affect demand for our services and the availability and cost of the materials and equipment we need to deliver our services. During periods of elevated and prolonged economic uncertainty our customers may delay, reduce or eliminate their spending on the services we provide. In addition, volatility in the debt or equity markets may impact our customers’ access to capital and result in the reduction or elimination of spending on the services we provide. Our vendors, suppliers and subcontractors may also be adversely affected by these conditions. These conditions, which can develop rapidly, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023, and fiscal 2022 accounting for approximately 57.7%, 66.7%, and 66.2%, of our total contract revenues, respectively. Our industry is highly competitive and the revenue we expect from an existing customer in any market could fail to be realized if competitors who offer comparable services to our customers do so on more favorable terms or have a better relationship with a customer. Additionally, the continued consolidation of the telecommunications industry could result in the loss of a customer if, as a result of a merger or acquisition involving one or more of our customers, the surviving entity chooses to use one of our competitors for the services we currently provide.The capital and operating expenditure budgets and seasonal spending patterns of our customers affect demand for our services. Generally, our customers have no obligation to assign specific amounts of work to us. Customers decide to engage us to provide services based on, among other things, the amount of capital they have available and their spending priorities. Our customers’ capital budgets may change for reasons over which we have no control. These changes may occur quickly and without advance notice. Any fluctuation in the capital or operating expenditure budgets and priorities of our customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Pandemics and public health emergencies could materially disrupt our business and negatively impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. Pandemics and public health emergencies may impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition in ways that are uncertain, unpredictable and outside of our control. The extent of the impact of such an event depends on the severity and duration of the public health emergency or pandemic, as well as the nature and duration of federal, state and local laws, orders, rules, emergency temporary standards, regulations and mandates, together with protocols and contractual requirements implemented by our customers, that may be enacted or newly enforced in response. Additionally, our ability to perform our work during such an event may be dependent on the governmental or societal responses to these circumstances in the markets in which we operate. A pandemic or public health emergency is likely to heighten and exacerbate the risks described herein. We experienced many of these risks in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Seasonality and adverse weather conditions affect demand for our services. Our contract revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality and are impacted by adverse weather changes as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, adverse weather, which is more likely to occur with greater frequency, severity, and duration during the winter, as well as reduced daylight hours, impact our operations during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April. Additionally, extreme weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornados, and natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, tropical storms, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, could also impact the demand for our services, or impact our ability to perform our services. Also, several holidays fall within the fiscal quarter ending in January, which decreases the number of available workdays in this fiscal quarter. Because of these 10Table of Contentsfactors, we are most likely to experience reduced revenue and profitability or losses during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April compared to the fiscal quarters ending in July and October.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from multi-year master service agreements and other long-term contracts which our customers may cancel at any time or may reschedule or modify previously assigned work. The majority of our long-term contracts are cancellable by our customers with little or no advance notice and for any, or no, reason. Our customers may also have the right to cancel or remove assigned work without canceling the contract or to reschedule or modify previously assigned work. In addition, these contracts typically include a fixed term that is subject to renewal or rebid on a periodic basis. We may be unsuccessful in securing contracts when their fixed terms expire. Our projected revenues assume that definitive work orders have been, or will be, issued by our customer, and that the work will be completed. The potential loss of work under master service agreements and other long-term contracts, or the rescheduling or modification of previously assigned work by a customer, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity, as well as any projections we provide.Our contracts contain provisions that may require us to pay damages or incur costs if we fail to meet our contractual obligations. If we do not meet our contractual obligations our customers may look to us to pay damages or pursue other remedies, including, in some instances, the payment of liquidated damages. Additionally, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or if our customer anticipates that we cannot meet our contractual obligations, our customers may, in certain circumstances, seek reimbursement from us to cover the incremental cost of having a third party complete or remediate our work. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or incur costs as a result of a failure to meet our contractual obligations. Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation, and revenues may be realized in different periods than initially reflected in our backlog. Our backlog includes the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under master services agreements and other contractual agreements with our customers. These estimates are based on, among other things, contract terms and projections regarding the timing of the services to be provided. In the case of master service agreements, backlog is calculated using as an input the amount of work performed in the preceding 12 month period, when applicable. Backlog for newly initiated master service agreements and other long and short-term contracts is estimated using the anticipated scope of the contract and information received from the customer in the procurement process. Generally, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services. Contract revenue estimates reflected in our backlog can be subject to change due to a number of factors, including contract cancellations or changes in the amount of work we expect to be performed. In addition, contract revenues reflected in our backlog may be realized in different periods from those previously anticipated due to these factors as well as project accelerations or delays due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in customer spending priorities, project cancellations, regulatory interruptions, scheduling changes, commercial issues, such as permitting, engineering revisions, job site conditions and adverse weather. The amount or timing of our backlog can also be impacted by the merger or acquisition activity of our customers. Our estimates of our customers’ requirements during a future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain estimate of the amount of, and timing of, future revenues and earnings.We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and contract assets, which could become uncollectible. We extend credit to our customers because we perform work under contracts prior to being able to bill for that work. Deteriorating conditions in the industries we serve, bankruptcies, or financial difficulties of a customer or within the telecommunications sector generally may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. In addition, although in some instances we may have the right to file liens for certain projects, we may not be successful in enforcing those liens. The failure or delay in payment by one or more of our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Our profitability is based on delivering services within the estimated costs established when we price our contracts. A significant portion of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks. Due to the fixed price nature of the tasks, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each task exceeds our original estimates, as pricing under these contracts is determined based on estimated costs established when we enter into the contracts. A variety of factors could negatively impact the actual cost we incur in performing our work, such as changes made by our customers to the scope and extent of the services that we are to provide under a contract, delays resulting from weather and any pandemic or public health emergency, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the contract, higher than expected costs of materials and labor, delays in obtaining necessary permits, under absorbed costs, and lower than anticipated productivity. An increase in costs due to any of these factors, or for other reasons, could adversely affect our results of operations.11Table of ContentsRegulatory changes and requirements associated with government funding that is associated with certain capital spending initiatives of our customers may affect their spending on the services we provide. Our customers operate in regulated industries and are subject to laws and regulations that can change frequently. Additionally, where our customers utilize governmental funding sources in connection with the work they contract us to perform, such work may be subject to new or enhanced regulatory requirements and compliance obligations. The application of new or enhanced regulatory requirements or obligations, or changes to the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may delay or constrain our ability to perform our work, increase our costs to perform our work without a corresponding increase in payment from our customers, and could cause our customers to reduce or delay spending on the services we provide, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.Technological change may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. We generate a significant majority of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. This industry has been and continues to be impacted by rapid technological change. These changes may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Further, technological change in the telecommunications industry not directly related to the services we provide may affect the ability of one or more of our customers to compete effectively, which could result in a reduction or elimination of their use of our services. Any reduction, elimination or delay of spending by one of our customers on the services we provide could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Our business is labor-intensive, and we may be unable to attract, retain and ensure the productivity of qualified employees or to pass increased labor and training costs to our customers. We are highly dependent upon our ability to employ, train, retain, and ensure the productivity of the skilled personnel needed to operate our business. Given the highly specialized work we perform, many of our employees receive training in, and possess, specialized technical skills that are necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain and ensure the productivity of the skilled labor force necessary to operate our business. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as the general rate of employment, competition for employees possessing the skills we need, the general health and welfare of our employees and the level of compensation required to hire, train and retain qualified employees. In addition, the uncertainty of contract awards and project delays can also present difficulties in appropriately sizing our skilled labor force. Furthermore, due to the fixed price nature of the tasks in our contracts, we may be unable to pass increases in labor and training costs on to our customers. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified employees or incur additional labor and training costs, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be unable to secure subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us, either of which may adversely affect our relationships with our customers or cause us to incur additional costs. We contract with subcontractors to manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amounts that we would otherwise expend on fixed assets and working capital. If we are unable to secure qualified subcontractors who can provide adequate labor resources at a reasonable cost, we may be delayed or unable to complete our work under a contract on a timely basis. In addition, we may have disputes with these subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by subcontractors. Any of these factors could negatively impact the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain customer contracts, and our relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Changes in fuel prices may increase our costs, and we may not be able to pass along increased fuel costs to our customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on events outside of our control. Most of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks and do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term. In addition, we may be unable to secure prices that reflect rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions in conjunction with our anticipated fuel purchases, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the hedges we have in place may require us to make payments to our hedge counterparties. As a result, changes in fuel prices may adversely affect our results of operations.Increases in healthcare costs could adversely affect our financial results. The costs of providing employee medical benefits have steadily increased over a number of years due to, among other things, rising healthcare costs and legislative requirements. Because of the complex nature of healthcare laws, as well as periodic healthcare reform legislation adopted by Congress, state legislatures, and municipalities, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on our healthcare costs. Continued increases in healthcare costs or additional costs created by future health care reform laws adopted by Congress, state legislatures, or municipalities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.12Table of ContentsFluctuations in our effective tax rate and tax liabilities may cause volatility in our financial results. We determine and provide for income taxes based on the tax laws of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the mix and level of earnings among jurisdictions could materially impact our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period. Our effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local level, or by new interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to audits by various taxing authorities. An adverse outcome from an audit could unfavorably impact our effective tax rate and increase our tax liabilities. We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. Reporting units are tested more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate their fair value may be below their carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of an annual or interim test, an impairment loss is recognized.Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand, increased costs of providing our services, and the level of overall economic activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects due to changes in technology, a slowing or uncertain economy, merger or acquisition activity, a decision to allocate resources to other areas of their business, or other reasons. The profitability of reporting units may also suffer if actual costs of providing our services exceed our estimated costs established when we enter into contracts. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a small number of customers may also cause results to vary. The factors identified above may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. A write-down of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment could adversely affect our results of operations.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2024, our common stock fluctuated from a low of $80.30 per share to a high of $116.13 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •events impacting us, or our competitors, with respect to significant contracts, acquisitions or dispositions, fluctuations in operating results, or change to capital structure;•announcements by our customers regarding their capital spending and start-up, deferral or cancellation of projects, or their mergers and acquisitions activities;•the commercialization of new technologies impacting the services that we provide to our customers; •regulatory and compliance obligations associated with government funding provided to our customers in connection with the work we perform, other regulatory actions, and changes in tax laws;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and •the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.In addition, other factors, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, widespread public health epidemics and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business Our operations involve activities that are often inherently dangerous and are performed at times in complex or sensitive environments. If our activities result in, or if it is alleged that our activities have resulted in, damage or destruction to the real or personal property of others, or in injury or death to others, we could be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. Our operations involve dangerous activities such as underground drilling and the use of mechanized equipment. These activities and their effects could result in, or be alleged to have resulted in, damage to the real and personal property of others, and cause personal injury or death to third 13Table of Contentsparties or our employees. In many instances, our activities are performed in close proximity to other utilities which, if damaged, may result in the occurrence of catastrophic events. Additionally, we may perform our activities in environmentally sensitive locations or in locations that may be susceptible to catastrophic events, including wildfires. If our activities cause or contribute to, or are alleged to have caused or contributed to, a catastrophic event, we could be exposed to severe financial losses and reputational harm. We procure insurance coverage to cover many of these risks; however, there can be no assurance that these coverages will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that they are adequate in scope or amount to address financial losses from these risks. As a result, we could incur significant costs to defend any such allegations, defend and indemnify our customers, repair and replace assets, or to compensate third parties; reputational harm could result in the loss of future revenue-generating opportunities; or we may be subject to civil and, in certain situations, criminal liabilities.Changes in the cost or availability of materials may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. For a majority of the contract services we perform, customers provide the necessary materials. Under other contracts, we supply part, or all, of the necessary materials. If we, or our customers, are unable to procure the materials necessary to the contract services we perform, or if those materials are only available at prices that make our work unprofitable, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. A failure, outage, or cybersecurity breach of our technology systems or those of third-party providers may adversely affect our operations and financial results. We are dependent on technology to operate our business, to engage with our customers and other third parties, and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the services we offer our customers. We use both our own information technology systems and the information technology systems and expertise of third-party service providers to manage our operations, process data for our financial reporting, and perform other business processes. We also use information technology systems to record, transmit, store, and protect sensitive data, including the sensitive data of our employees and customers. A cyber-security attack, computer viruses, security breaches, or vandalism on these information technology systems may result in our inability to access and utilize these systems, create or contribute to significant financial losses, and may negatively impact our reputation. The systems of our customers that we utilize to transmit and receive information could also fail or be subject to a cybersecurity attack. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business or the delivery of services to our customers, result in potential liabilities, the termination of contracts, divert the attention of management from effectively operating our business, cause significant reputational damage, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results. We may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against cybersecurity threats or to address actual breaches or to redress problems caused by cybersecurity breaches.We have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and attacks attempting to breach our systems and other similar incidents. In 2017, we determined that certain of our computer systems containing Company financial information were subject to unauthorized access. Law enforcement authorities were notified and new security enhancements and protocols were implemented. Although these prior cybersecurity incidents have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity, there is no assurance that future threats would not cause harm to our business and our reputation, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business. We rely on information technology systems to record and process transactions, manage our business, and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our information technology systems may be adversely impacted by various factors, including power outages, software and hardware failures, connectivity outages, catastrophic events, and human error. Interruptions to our information systems could disrupt our business, delay our financial reporting, and could result in the loss of revenue, and cause us to incur additional expense. We are in the process of implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to upgrade and standardize our information technology systems. This implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. Any delays or failures to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to complete the implementation on a timely basis, or to adequately address the necessary readiness and training needs of our personnel, could lead to business disruption, negatively affect our customer relationships, and restrict our ability to execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business.The loss or long-term incapacitation of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We depend on the continued and ongoing services of our executive officers and other key employees, including the senior management of our subsidiaries. In many instances, these employees have significant experience and expertise in our industry. These key employees often possess and maintain key relationships with our customers and subcontractors that would be difficult to replace. Competition for senior management personnel is intense and we cannot be certain that any of our executive officers or other key management personnel will remain employed by us or that they will otherwise be able to provide service to us for any length of time. Additionally, we may not have adequate succession 14Table of Contentsplanning in place to ensure that our key employees can be replaced if they are no longer employed by us. We do not carry “key-person” life or disability insurance on any of our employees. The loss or long-term incapacitation of any one of our executive officers or other key employees could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business.The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated precisely from available data at the time that these estimates are made and, accordingly, requires the use of management’s judgment. Estimates and assumptions are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue under the cost-to-cost method of progress, job-specific costs, accrued insurance claims, the allowance for doubtful accounts, accruals for contingencies, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, the fair value of reporting units for the goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, and income taxes. When made, we believe such estimates and assumptions are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, and such differences may be material to our financial statements.Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Our failure to comply with occupational health and workplace safety requirements could result in significant liabilities or enforcement actions and adversely impact our ability to perform services for our customers. Our operations are subject to strict laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery, work on and in the vicinity of electrical and gas lines, perform their work at heights, and engage in other potentially dangerous activities which could subject them and others to injury or death. If, in the course of our operations, it is determined we have violated safety regulations, our operations may be disrupted and we may be subject to penalties, fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, if our safety performance were to deteriorate, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to comply with worker eligibility and immigration laws could result in significant liabilities and harm our reputation with our customers, as well as cause disruption to our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws our operations may be disrupted, and we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, many of our customer contracts specifically require compliance with worker eligibility and immigration laws and in some cases our customers audit compliance with these laws. Further, several of our customers require that we ensure our subcontractors comply with these laws with respect to the workers that perform services for them. A failure to comply with these laws could damage our reputation and may result in the cancellation of our contracts by our customers, or a decision by our customers not to award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to comply with various laws and regulations related to the construction and operation of utilities, contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles could result in significant liabilities. We are subject to a number of state and federal laws and regulations, including those related to the construction and operation of utilities, contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations, we may be unable to perform services for our customers and may also be subject to fines, penalties, and the suspension or revocation of our licenses. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may affect our ability to operate and could require us to incur significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations.Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers and we often operate in close proximity to pipelines, sewer lines, or underground storage tanks that may contain hazardous substances. We could be subject to liabilities in the event that we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations or if we cause or are responsible for the release of hazardous substances or other environmental damages. These liabilities could result in significant costs including remediation costs, fines, third-party claims for property damage, or personal injury, and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. These costs, as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new remediation requirements could require 15Table of Contentsus to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We retain the risk of loss for the occurrence of certain liabilities. We retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits in our insurance program, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), environmental liability, workers’ compensation, and employee group health. We are effectively self-insured for the majority of claims because most claims against us fall below the deductibles or retention levels of our insurance policies. Additionally, within our aggregate coverage limits and above our base layer of third-party insurance coverage, we have retained the risk of loss at certain levels of exposure and any claims that reach these retained levels of exposure are self-insured. We estimate and develop our reserve accruals for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances, and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as our ultimate losses may depend on factors not known at the time such estimates are made. These factors include the estimated development of claims, the payment pattern of claims incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions, and court interpretations. Should the cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 11, Accrued Insurance Claims, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may be subject to litigation, indemnity claims, and other disputes, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. From time to time, we are subject to lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, and other claims brought or threatened against us by various parties, including our customers. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for personal injury, workers’ compensation, wage and hour violations, employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, liquidated damages, consequential damages, punitive damages, statutory damages, and civil penalties, other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we may also be subject to class action lawsuits, including those alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, state and municipal wage and hour laws, and misclassification of independent contractors. We also indemnify our customers for claims arising out of or related to the services we provide and our actions or omissions under our contracts. In some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for the actions or omissions of our customers, subcontractors, or other third parties.Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Class action lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts. Accordingly, the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. These proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require us to devote substantial resources to our defense. The ultimate resolution of any litigation or proceeding through settlement, mediation, or a judgment could have a material impact on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may be subject to warranty claims, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. We typically warrant the services we provide by guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and materials or where our services are not provided in a manner consistent with applicable requirements. When these claims occur, we may be required to repair or replace our work without receiving any additional compensation and we may be liable to our customers for significant monetary claims. Our performance of warranty services requires us to allocate resources that otherwise might be engaged in the provision of services that generate revenue. In addition, our customers often have the right to repair or replace warrantied items using the services of another provider and to charge the cost of the repair or replacement to us. Costs incurred for warranty claims, or reductions to revenue-generating activities arising from the allocation of resources to resolve warranty claims, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our subsidiaries may participate in multiemployer pension plans from time to time under which we could incur significant liabilities. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, our subsidiaries may participate in various multiemployer pension plans from time to time that provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. Where applicable, we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to participants. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to providing benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement 16Table of ContentsIncome Security Act (“ERISA”), absent an applicable exemption, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon withdrawal from the plan for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liability. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate become significantly underfunded, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions in the form of higher contribution rates or surcharges. This could occur because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on plan assets, or other funding deficiencies. Requirements to pay increased contributions or a withdrawal liability could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, one of the Company’s subsidiaries ceased operations. This subsidiary contributed to a multiemployer pension plan, the Pension, Hospitalization and Benefit Plan of the Electrical Industry - Pension Trust Fund (the “Plan”). In October 2016, the Plan demanded payment for a claimed withdrawal liability of approximately $13.0 million. In December 2016, the subsidiary submitted a formal request to the Plan seeking review of the Plan’s withdrawal liability determination. The subsidiary disputes the claim that it is required to make payment of a withdrawal liability as demanded by the Plan as it believes that a statutory exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) applies to its activities. The Plan has taken the position that the work at issue does not qualify for that statutory exemption. The subsidiary has submitted this dispute to arbitration, as required by ERISA. In that proceeding, the arbitrator has issued an order indicating that the statutory exemption is not available to the Company’s subsidiary, and the Company’s subsidiary is appealing the arbitrator’s ruling on various grounds. There can be no assurance that the Company’s subsidiary will be successful in its appeal of the arbitrator’s ruling regarding this statutory exemption. As required by ERISA, this subsidiary began making payments of a withdrawal liability to the Plan in the amount of approximately $0.1 million per month in November 2016. The aggregate amount of these payments has been recorded as an asset. If the subsidiary prevails in disputing the withdrawal liability, all such payments are expected to be refunded. Given the early stage of this action, it is not possible to estimate a range of loss that could result from either an adverse judgment or a settlement of this matter. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our Company or a change in our control. We are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control. In addition, certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders have the right to elect only approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders. As a result, our shareholders may be unable to take advantage of opportunities to dispose of their stock in the Company at higher prices that may otherwise be available in connection with takeover attempts or under a merger or other proposal.We may face challenges in setting and meeting our corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals. We have begun to assess and develop corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals for our company. Our customers, shareholders, and other constituents may not be satisfied with the corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals that we may set. Any targets or goals we do set will be subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which may be outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail to achieve any goals and targets we do set. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to execute our operational strategies and achieve our goals; the availability of new technologies and equipment that operates on these technologies on a cost-effective basis; overlapping and contradictory requirements and scoring and evaluating our goals; the inability to effectively impose requirements on our suppliers and subcontractors; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. A failure to set appropriate corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals for our company, or our failure to meet these goals could adversely affect public perception of our business or customer or shareholder support.Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our BusinessWe may not have access in the future to sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to pursue acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, for working capital needs, or to respond to changing business conditions. Our existing debt agreements include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt at certain levels. In 17Table of Contentsaddition, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to access additional capital could adversely affect our liquidity and may limit our growth and ability to execute our business strategy.Our debt obligations impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility, and a failure to comply with these obligations could result in the acceleration of our debt. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are party to that certain amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of October 19, 2018, with the various lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (as amended on April 1, 2021 and May 9, 2023, the “Credit Agreement”) which includes a revolving facility with a maximum revolver commitment of $650.0 million and a term loan facility in the principal amount of $350.0 million. The Credit Agreement includes a $200.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The maturity of the Credit Agreement is April 1, 2026. As of January 27, 2024, we had $315.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility and $47.5 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our Credit Agreement. We had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility as of January 27, 2024. This Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict or limit our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make investments or create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell certain assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. Our Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. These covenants in our Credit Agreement may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us and may limit our flexibility in the execution of our business strategy. Additionally, on April 1, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The 2029 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by all of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Agreement. The indenture governing the 2029 Notes includes cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions with our Credit Agreement. If our financial results fall below anticipated levels, we may be unable to comply with these covenants and a default under our Credit Agreement could result in the acceleration of our obligations under both our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 2029 Notes, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business strategy.The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous local and regional providers, as well as several large corporations that may have financial, technical, and marketing resources exceeding ours. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. Any organization may become a competitor if it has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise, the ability to engage subcontractors, and the necessary equipment and materials. Additionally, our competitors may develop expertise, experience, and resources to provide services that are equal or superior to our services in price, quality, or availability, and we may be unable to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of our contracts upon the expiration of their terms. If competitors underbid us to procure business, we could be required to lower the prices we charge in order to retain contracts. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our customers shift a significant portion of our work to a competitor, if we are unsuccessful in bidding or retaining projects, or if our ability to win projects requires us to provide our services at reduced margins.We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers. We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our existing or prospective customers reduce the specialty contracting services that are outsourced to us. Our failure to perform sufficient due diligence prior to completing acquisitions could result in significant liabilities. The growth of our business through acquisitions may expose us to risks, including the failure to identify significant issues and risks of an acquired business. A failure to identify or appropriately quantify a liability in our due diligence process could result in the assumption of unanticipated liabilities arising from the prior operations of an acquired business, some of which may not be adequately reserved and may not be covered by indemnification obligations. The assumption of unknown liabilities due to a failure of our due diligence could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our financial results. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that we expect to expand, complement, or diversify our business. The success of this 18Table of Contentsstrategy depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing operations and the elimination of redundant costs. To realize these benefits, we must successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations. Integrating acquired businesses involves a number of operational challenges and risks, including diversion of management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications, and other systems and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company; and failure to retain management and other key employees. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.19Table of Contents"
9,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2023-03-03,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Financial Performance or General Economic ConditionsEconomic downturns, uncertain economic conditions, and capital market fluctuations may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recessionary conditions, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, availability of credit, and interest rates could materially adversely affect demand for our services and the availability and cost of the materials and equipment we need to deliver our services. During periods of elevated and prolonged economic uncertainty our customers may delay, reduce or eliminate their spending on the services we provide. In addition, volatility in the debt or equity markets may impact our customers’ access to capital and result in the reduction or elimination of spending on the services we provide. Our vendors, suppliers and subcontractors may also be adversely affected by these conditions. These conditions, which can develop rapidly, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022, and fiscal 2021 accounting for approximately 66.7%, 66.2%, and 74.1%, of our total contract revenues, respectively. Our industry is highly competitive and the revenue we expect from an existing customer in any market could fail to be realized if competitors who offer comparable services to our customers do so on more favorable terms or have a better relationship with a customer. Additionally, the continued consolidation of the telecommunications industry could result in the loss of a customer if, as a result of a merger or acquisition involving one or more of our customers, the surviving entity chooses to use one of our competitors for the services we currently provide.The capital and operating expenditure budgets and seasonal spending patterns of our customers affect demand for our services. Generally, our customers have no obligation to assign specific amounts of work to us. Customers decide to engage us to provide services based on, among other things, the amount of capital they have available and their spending priorities. Our customers’ capital budgets may change for reasons over which we have no control. These changes may occur quickly and without advance notice. Any fluctuation in the capital or operating expenditure budgets and priorities of our customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Pandemics and public health emergencies could materially disrupt our business and negatively impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. Pandemics and public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition in ways that are uncertain, unpredictable and outside of our control. The extent of the impact of such an event depends on the severity and duration of the public health emergency or pandemic, as well as the nature and duration of federal, state and local laws, orders, rules, emergency temporary standards, regulations and mandates, together with protocols and contractual requirements implemented by our customers, that may be enacted or newly enforced in response. Additionally, our ability to perform our work during such an event may be dependent on the governmental or societal responses to these circumstances in the markets in which we operate. A pandemic or public health emergency is likely to heighten and exacerbate the risks described herein. We experienced many of these risks in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. Any resurgence of infection rates or the spread of new variants or viruses could trigger a return of many of the risks and circumstances we experienced in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Seasonality and adverse weather conditions affect demand for our services. Our contract revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality and are impacted by adverse weather changes as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, adverse weather, which is more likely to occur with greater frequency, severity, and duration during the winter, as well as reduced daylight hours, impact our operations during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April. Additionally, extreme weather conditions such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornados, and natural disasters, such as floods, hurricanes, tropical storms, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, could also impact the demand for our services, or impact our ability to perform our services. Also, several holidays fall within the 10Table of Contentsfiscal quarter ending in January, which decreases the number of available workdays in this fiscal quarter. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience reduced revenue and profitability or losses during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April compared to the fiscal quarters ending in July and October.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from multi-year master service agreements and other long-term contracts which our customers may cancel at any time or may reschedule or modify previously assigned work. The majority of our long-term contracts are cancellable by our customers with little or no advance notice and for any, or no, reason. Our customers may also have the right to cancel or remove assigned work without canceling the contract or to reschedule or modify previously assigned work. In addition, these contracts typically include a fixed term that is subject to renewal or rebid on a periodic basis. We may be unsuccessful in securing contracts when their fixed terms expire. Our projected revenues assume that definitive work orders have been, or will be, issued by our customer, and that the work will be completed. The potential loss of work under master service agreements and other long-term contracts, or the rescheduling or modification of previously assigned work by a customer, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity, as well as any projections we provide.Our contracts contain provisions that may require us to pay damages or incur costs if we fail to meet our contractual obligations. If we do not meet our contractual obligations our customers may look to us to pay damages or pursue other remedies, including, in some instances, the payment of liquidated damages. Additionally, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or if our customer anticipates that we cannot meet our contractual obligations, our customers may, in certain circumstances, seek reimbursement from us to cover the incremental cost of having a third party complete or remediate our work. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or incur costs as a result of a failure to meet our contractual obligations. Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation, and revenues may be realized in different periods than initially reflected in our backlog. Our backlog includes the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under master services agreements and other contractual agreements with our customers. These estimates are based on, among other things, contract terms and projections regarding the timing of the services to be provided. In the case of master service agreements, backlog is calculated using as an input the amount of work performed in the preceding 12 month period, when applicable. Backlog for newly initiated master service agreements and other long and short-term contracts is estimated using the anticipated scope of the contract and information received from the customer in the procurement process. Generally, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services. Contract revenue estimates reflected in our backlog can be subject to change due to a number of factors, including contract cancellations or changes in the amount of work we expect to be performed. In addition, contract revenues reflected in our backlog may be realized in different periods from those previously anticipated due to these factors as well as project accelerations or delays due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in customer spending priorities, project cancellations, regulatory interruptions, scheduling changes, commercial issues, such as permitting, engineering revisions, job site conditions and adverse weather. The amount or timing of our backlog can also be impacted by the merger or acquisition activity of our customers. Our estimates of our customers’ requirements during a future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain estimate of the amount of, and timing of, future revenues and earnings.We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and contract assets, which could become uncollectible. We extend credit to our customers because we perform work under contracts prior to being able to bill for that work. Deteriorating conditions in the industries we serve, bankruptcies, or financial difficulties of a customer or within the telecommunications sector generally may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. In addition, although in some instances we may have the right to file liens for certain projects, we may not be successful in enforcing those liens. The failure or delay in payment by one or more of our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Our profitability is based on delivering services within the estimated costs established when we price our contracts. A significant portion of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks. Due to the fixed price nature of the tasks, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each task exceeds our original estimates, as pricing under these contracts is determined based on estimated costs established when we enter into the contracts. A variety of factors could negatively impact the actual cost we incur in performing our work, such as changes made by our customers to the scope and extent of the services that we are to provide under a contract, delays resulting from weather and the COVID-19 pandemic, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the contract, higher than expected costs of materials and labor, delays in obtaining necessary permits, under 11Table of Contentsabsorbed costs, and lower than anticipated productivity. An increase in costs due to any of these factors, or for other reasons, could adversely affect our results of operations.Regulatory changes and requirements associated with government funding that is associated with certain capital spending initiatives of our customers may affect their spending on the services we provide. Our customers operate in regulated industries and are subject to laws and regulations that can change frequently. Additionally, where our customers utilize governmental funding sources in connection with the work they contract us to perform, such work may be subject to new or enhanced regulatory requirements and compliance obligations. The application of new or enhanced regulatory requirements or obligations, or changes to the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may delay or constrain our ability to perform our work, increase our costs to perform our work without a corresponding increase in payment from our customers, and could cause our customers to reduce or delay spending on the services we provide, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.Technological change may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. We generate a significant majority of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. This industry has been and continues to be impacted by rapid technological change. These changes may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Further, technological change in the telecommunications industry not directly related to the services we provide may affect the ability of one or more of our customers to compete effectively, which could result in a reduction or elimination of their use of our services. Any reduction, elimination or delay of spending by one of our customers on the services we provide could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Our business is labor-intensive, and we may be unable to attract, retain and ensure the productivity of qualified employees or to pass increased labor and training costs to our customers. We are highly dependent upon our ability to employ, train, retain, and ensure the productivity of the skilled personnel needed to operate our business. Given the highly specialized work we perform, many of our employees receive training in, and possess, specialized technical skills that are necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain and ensure the productivity of the skilled labor force necessary to operate our business. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as the general rate of employment, competition for employees possessing the skills we need, the general health and welfare of our employees and the level of compensation required to hire, train and retain qualified employees. In addition, the uncertainty of contract awards and project delays can also present difficulties in appropriately sizing our skilled labor force. Furthermore, due to the fixed price nature of the tasks in our contracts, we may be unable to pass increases in labor and training costs on to our customers. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified employees or incur additional labor and training costs, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be unable to secure subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us, either of which may adversely affect our relationships with our customers or cause us to incur additional costs. We contract with subcontractors to manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amounts that we would otherwise expend on fixed assets and working capital. If we are unable to secure qualified subcontractors who can provide adequate labor resources at a reasonable cost, we may be delayed or unable to complete our work under a contract on a timely basis. In addition, we may have disputes with these subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by subcontractors. Any of these factors could negatively impact the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain customer contracts, and our relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Changes in fuel prices may increase our costs, and we may not be able to pass along increased fuel costs to our customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on events outside of our control. Most of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks and do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term. In addition, we may be unable to secure prices that reflect rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions in conjunction with our anticipated fuel purchases, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the hedges we have in place may require us to make payments to our hedge counterparties. As a result, changes in fuel prices may adversely affect our results of operations.Increases in healthcare costs could adversely affect our financial results. The costs of providing employee medical benefits have steadily increased over a number of years due to, among other things, rising healthcare costs and legislative requirements. Because of the complex nature of healthcare laws, as well as periodic healthcare reform legislation adopted by Congress, state legislatures, and municipalities, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on our healthcare costs. Continued increases in healthcare costs or additional costs created by future health care reform laws adopted by Congress, state legislatures, or municipalities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.12Table of ContentsFluctuations in our effective tax rate and tax liabilities may cause volatility in our financial results. We determine and provide for income taxes based on the tax laws of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the mix and level of earnings among jurisdictions could materially impact our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period. Our effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local level, or by new interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to audits by various taxing authorities. An adverse outcome from an audit could unfavorably impact our effective tax rate and increase our tax liabilities. We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. Reporting units are tested more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate their fair value may be below their carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of an annual or interim test, an impairment loss is recognized.Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand, increased costs of providing our services, and the level of overall economic activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects due to changes in technology, a slowing or uncertain economy, merger or acquisition activity, a decision to allocate resources to other areas of their business, or other reasons. The profitability of reporting units may also suffer if actual costs of providing our services exceed our estimated costs established when we enter into contracts. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a small number of customers may also cause results to vary. The factors identified above may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. A write-down of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment could adversely affect our results of operations.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2023, our common stock fluctuated from a low of $76.79 per share to a high of $121.11 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •events impacting us, or our competitors, with respect to significant contracts, acquisitions or dispositions, fluctuations in operating results, or change to capital structure;•announcements by our customers regarding their capital spending and start-up, deferral or cancellation of projects, or their mergers and acquisitions activities;•the commercialization of new technologies impacting the services that we provide to our customers; •regulatory and compliance obligations associated with government funding provided to our customers in connection with the work we perform, other regulatory actions, and changes in tax laws;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and •the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.In addition, other factors, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, widespread public health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business Our operations involve activities that are often inherently dangerous and are performed at times in complex or sensitive environments. If our activities result in, or if it is alleged that our activities have resulted in, damage or destruction to the real or personal property of others, or in injury or death to others, we could be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. Our operations involve dangerous activities such as underground drilling and the use of mechanized equipment. These activities and their effects could result in, or be 13Table of Contentsalleged to have resulted in, damage to the real and personal property of others, and cause personal injury or death to third parties or our employees. In many instances, our activities are performed in close proximity to other utilities which, if damaged, may result in the occurrence of catastrophic events. Additionally, we may perform our activities in environmentally sensitive locations or in locations that may be susceptible to catastrophic events, including wildfires. If our activities cause or contribute to, or are alleged to have caused or contributed to, a catastrophic event, we could be exposed to severe financial losses and reputational harm. We procure insurance coverage to cover many of these risks; however, there can be no assurance that these coverages will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that they are adequate in scope or amount to address financial losses from these risks. As a result, we could incur significant costs to defend any such allegations, defend and indemnify our customers, repair and replace assets, or to compensate third parties; reputational harm could result in the loss of future revenue-generating opportunities; or we may be subject to civil and, in certain situations, criminal liabilities.Changes in the cost or availability of materials may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. For a majority of the contract services we perform, customers provide the necessary materials. Under other contracts, we supply part, or all, of the necessary materials. If we, or our customers, are unable to procure the materials necessary to the contract services we perform, or if those materials are only available at prices that make our work unprofitable, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. A failure, outage, or cybersecurity breach of our technology systems or those of third-party providers may adversely affect our operations and financial results. We are dependent on technology to operate our business, to engage with our customers and other third parties, and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the services we offer our customers. We use both our own information technology systems and the information technology systems and expertise of third-party service providers to manage our operations, process data for our financial reporting, and perform other business processes. We also use information technology systems to record, transmit, store, and protect sensitive data, including the sensitive data of our employees and customers. A cyber-security attack, computer viruses, security breaches, or vandalism on these information technology systems may result in our inability to access and utilize these systems, create or contribute to significant financial losses, and may negatively impact our reputation. The systems of our customers that we utilize to transmit and receive information could also fail or be subject to a cybersecurity attack. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business or the delivery of services to our customers, result in potential liabilities, the termination of contracts, divert the attention of management from effectively operating our business, cause significant reputational damage, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results. We may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against cybersecurity threats or to address actual breaches or to redress problems caused by cybersecurity breaches.We have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and attacks attempting to breach our systems and other similar incidents. In 2017, we determined that certain of our computer systems containing Company financial information were subject to unauthorized access. Law enforcement authorities were notified and new security enhancements and protocols were implemented. Although these prior cybersecurity incidents have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity, there is no assurance that future threats would not cause harm to our business and our reputation, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.A failure in our information technology systems could negatively impact our business. We rely on information technology systems to record and process transactions, manage our business, and maintain the financial accuracy of our records. Our information technology systems may be adversely impacted by various factors, including power outages, software and hardware failures, connectivity outages, catastrophic events, and human error. Interruptions to our information systems could disrupt our business, delay our financial reporting, and could result in the loss of revenue, and cause us to incur additional expense. We are in the process of implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system to upgrade and standardize our information technology systems. This implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. Any delays or failures to achieve our implementation goals may adversely impact our financial results. In addition, the failure to complete the implementation on a timely basis, or to adequately address the necessary readiness and training needs of our personnel, could lead to business disruption, negatively affect our customer relationships, and restrict our ability to execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business.The loss or long-term incapacitation of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We depend on the continued and ongoing services of our executive officers and other key employees, including the senior management of our subsidiaries. In many instances, these employees have significant experience and expertise in our industry. These key employees often possess and maintain key relationships with our customers and subcontractors that would be difficult to replace. Competition for senior management personnel is intense and we cannot be certain that any of our executive officers or other key management personnel will remain employed by us or that they will 14Table of Contentsotherwise be able to provide service to us for any length of time. Additionally, we may not have adequate succession planning in place to ensure that our key employees can be replaced if they are no longer employed by us. We do not carry “key-person” life or disability insurance on any of our employees. The loss or long-term incapacitation of any one of our executive officers or other key employees could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business.The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated precisely from available data at the time that these estimates are made and, accordingly, requires the use of management’s judgment. Estimates and assumptions are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue under the cost-to-cost method of progress, job-specific costs, accrued insurance claims, the allowance for doubtful accounts, accruals for contingencies, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, the fair value of reporting units for the goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, and income taxes. When made, we believe such estimates and assumptions are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, and such differences may be material to our financial statements.Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Our failure to comply with occupational health and workplace safety requirements could result in significant liabilities or enforcement actions and adversely impact our ability to perform services for our customers. Our operations are subject to strict laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery, work on and in the vicinity of electrical and gas lines, perform their work at heights, and engage in other potentially dangerous activities which could subject them and others to injury or death. If, in the course of our operations, it is determined we have violated safety regulations, our operations may be disrupted and we may be subject to penalties, fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, if our safety performance were to deteriorate, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to comply with worker eligibility and immigration laws could result in significant liabilities and harm our reputation with our customers, as well as cause disruption to our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws our operations may be disrupted, and we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, many of our customer contracts specifically require compliance with worker eligibility and immigration laws and in some cases our customers audit compliance with these laws. Further, several of our customers require that we ensure our subcontractors comply with these laws with respect to the workers that perform services for them. A failure to comply with these laws could damage our reputation and may result in the cancellation of our contracts by our customers, or a decision by our customers not to award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to comply with various laws and regulations related to the construction and operation of utilities, contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles could result in significant liabilities. We are subject to a number of state and federal laws and regulations, including those related to the construction and operation of utilities, contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations, we may be unable to perform services for our customers and may also be subject to fines, penalties, and the suspension or revocation of our licenses. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may affect our ability to operate and could require us to incur significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations.Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers and we often operate in close proximity to pipelines, sewer lines, or underground storage tanks that may contain hazardous substances. We could be subject to liabilities in the event that we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations or if we cause or are responsible for the release of hazardous substances or other environmental damages. These liabilities could result in significant costs including remediation costs, fines, third-party claims for property damage, or personal injury, and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. These costs, as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new remediation requirements could require 15Table of Contentsus to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We retain the risk of loss for the occurrence of certain liabilities. We retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits in our insurance program, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), environmental liability, workers’ compensation, and employee group health. We are effectively self-insured for the majority of claims because most claims against us fall below the deductibles or retention levels of our insurance policies. Additionally, within our aggregate coverage limits and above our base layer of third-party insurance coverage, we have retained the risk of loss at certain levels of exposure and any claims that reach these retained levels of exposure are self-insured. We estimate and develop our reserve accruals for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances, and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as our ultimate losses may depend on factors not known at the time such estimates are made. These factors include the estimated development of claims, the payment pattern of claims incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions, and court interpretations. Should the cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 10, Accrued Insurance Claims, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may be subject to litigation, indemnity claims, and other disputes, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. From time to time, we are subject to lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, and other claims brought or threatened against us by various parties, including our customers. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for personal injury, workers’ compensation, wage and hour violations, employment discrimination, harassment, retaliation, and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, liquidated damages, consequential damages, punitive damages, statutory damages, and civil penalties, other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we may also be subject to class action lawsuits, including those alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, state and municipal wage and hour laws, and misclassification of independent contractors. We also indemnify our customers for claims arising out of or related to the services we provide and our actions or omissions under our contracts. In some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for the actions or omissions of our customers, subcontractors, or other third parties.Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution proceedings, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Class action lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts. Accordingly, the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. These proceedings could result in substantial costs and may require us to devote substantial resources to our defense. The ultimate resolution of any litigation or proceeding through settlement, mediation, or a judgment could have a material impact on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may be subject to warranty claims, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. We typically warrant the services we provide by guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and materials or where our services are not provided in a manner consistent with applicable requirements. When these claims occur, we may be required to repair or replace our work without receiving any additional compensation and we may be liable to our customers for significant monetary claims. Our performance of warranty services requires us to allocate resources that otherwise might be engaged in the provision of services that generate revenue. In addition, our customers often have the right to repair or replace warrantied items using the services of another provider and to charge the cost of the repair or replacement to us. Costs incurred for warranty claims, or reductions to revenue-generating activities arising from the allocation of resources to resolve warranty claims, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our subsidiaries may participate in multiemployer pension plans from time to time under which we could incur significant liabilities. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, our subsidiaries may participate in various multiemployer pension plans from time to time that provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. Where applicable, we make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to participants. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to providing benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement 16Table of ContentsIncome Security Act (“ERISA”), absent an applicable exemption, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon withdrawal from the plan for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liability. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate become significantly underfunded, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions in the form of higher contribution rates or surcharges. This could occur because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on plan assets, or other funding deficiencies. Requirements to pay increased contributions or a withdrawal liability could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, one of the Company’s subsidiaries ceased operations. This subsidiary contributed to a multiemployer pension plan, the Pension, Hospitalization and Benefit Plan of the Electrical Industry - Pension Trust Fund (the “Plan”). In October 2016, the Plan demanded payment for a claimed withdrawal liability of approximately $13.0 million. In December 2016, the subsidiary submitted a formal request to the Plan seeking review of the Plan’s withdrawal liability determination. The subsidiary disputes the claim that it is required to make payment of a withdrawal liability as demanded by the Plan as it believes that a statutory exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) applies to its activities. The Plan has taken the position that the work at issue does not qualify for that statutory exemption. The subsidiary has submitted this dispute to arbitration, as required by ERISA, and an arbitrator has ruled that the subsidiary does not qualify for the statutory exemption. The subsidiary is appealing the arbitrator’s ruling on various grounds. There can be no assurance that the Company’s subsidiary will be successful in its appeal of the arbitrator’s ruling regarding this statutory exemption. In November 2016, this subsidiary began making payments of a withdrawal liability to the Plan in the amount of approximately $0.1 million per month, as required by ERISA. If the subsidiary prevails in disputing the withdrawal liability, all such payments are expected to be refunded.Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our Company or a change in our control. We are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control. In addition, certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders have the right to elect only approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders. As a result, our shareholders may be unable to take advantage of opportunities to dispose of their stock in the Company at higher prices that may otherwise be available in connection with takeover attempts or under a merger or other proposal.We may face challenges in setting and meeting our corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals. We have begun to assess and develop corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals for our company. Our customers, shareholders, and other constituents may not be satisfied with the corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals that we may set. Any targets or goals we do set will be subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which may be outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail to achieve any goals and targets we do set. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to execute our operational strategies and achieve our goals; the availability of new technologies and equipment that operates on these technologies on a cost-effective basis; overlapping and contradictory requirements and scoring and evaluating our goals; the inability to effectively impose requirements on our suppliers and subcontractors; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. A failure to set appropriate corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals for our company, or our failure to meet these goals could adversely affect public perception of our business or customer or shareholder support.Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our BusinessWe may not have access in the future to sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to pursue acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, for working capital needs, or to respond to changing business conditions. Our existing debt agreements include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt at certain levels. In addition, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such 17Table of Contentsfunding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to access additional capital could adversely affect our liquidity and may limit our growth and ability to execute our business strategy.Our debt obligations impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility, and a failure to comply with these obligations could result in the acceleration of our debt. On April 1, 2021, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries amended its credit agreement, dated as of October 19, 2018, with the various lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Credit Agreement”) to among other things, decrease the maximum revolver commitment to $650.0 million from $750.0 million and decrease the term loan facility to $350.0 million from $416.3 million. The Credit Agreement includes a $200.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. As part of the amendment, the maturity of the Credit Agreement was extended to April 1, 2026. As of January 28, 2023, we had $332.5 million outstanding under the term loan facility and $47.5 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our Credit Agreement. We had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility as of January 28, 2023. This Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict or limit our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make investments or create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell certain assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. Our Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. These covenants in our Credit Agreement may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us and may limit our flexibility in the execution of our business strategy. Additionally, on April 1, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The 2029 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by all of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Agreement. The indenture governing the 2029 Notes includes cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions with our Credit Agreement. If our financial results fall below anticipated levels, we may be unable to comply with these covenants and a default under our Credit Agreement could result in the acceleration of our obligations under both our Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 2029 Notes, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business strategy.The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous local and regional providers, as well as several large corporations that may have financial, technical, and marketing resources exceeding ours. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. Any organization may become a competitor if it has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise, the ability to engage subcontractors, and the necessary equipment and materials. Additionally, our competitors may develop expertise, experience, and resources to provide services that are equal or superior to our services in price, quality, or availability, and we may be unable to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of our contracts upon the expiration of their terms. If competitors underbid us to procure business, we could be required to lower the prices we charge in order to retain contracts. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our customers shift a significant portion of our work to a competitor, if we are unsuccessful in bidding or retaining projects, or if our ability to win projects requires us to provide our services at reduced margins.We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers. We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our existing or prospective customers reduce the specialty contracting services that are outsourced to us. Our failure to perform sufficient due diligence prior to completing acquisitions could result in significant liabilities. The growth of our business through acquisitions may expose us to risks, including the failure to identify significant issues and risks of an acquired business. A failure to identify or appropriately quantify a liability in our due diligence process could result in the assumption of unanticipated liabilities arising from the prior operations of an acquired business, some of which may not be adequately reserved and may not be covered by indemnification obligations. The assumption of unknown liabilities due to a failure of our due diligence could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our financial results. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that we expect to expand, complement, or diversify our business. The success of this strategy depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing operations and the elimination of redundant costs. To realize these benefits, we must successfully integrate the 18Table of Contentsoperations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations. Integrating acquired businesses involves a number of operational challenges and risks, including diversion of management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications, and other systems and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company; and failure to retain management and other key employees. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.19Table of Contents"

.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.Risks Related to Financial Performance or General Economic ConditionsEconomic downturns, uncertain economic conditions, and capital market fluctuations may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, slower growth or recessionary conditions, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, and tighter credit and higher interest rates could materially adversely affect demand for our services and the availability and cost of the materials and equipment we need to deliver our services. During periods of elevated and prolonged economic uncertainty our customers may delay, reduce or eliminate their spending on the services we provide. In addition, volatility in the debt or equity markets may impact our customers’ access to capital and result in the reduction or elimination of spending on the services we provide. Our vendors, suppliers and subcontractors may also be, to varying degrees, adversely affected by these conditions. These conditions, which can develop rapidly, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our operations and is expected to continue to pose risks that could materially disrupt our business and negatively impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. The economy of the United States has been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and by the nation’s response to it. Measures mandated by governmental agencies have included vaccination and masking requirements, travel and large gathering restrictions, social distancing requirements, quarantines, and shelter in place orders. Even as efforts to contain the pandemic have made progress and some restrictions have relaxed, new variants of COVID-19 have resulted in, and may continue to result in, additional outbreaks. As a result, certain business-related activities have been curtailed or modified. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our services have generally been considered essential in nature and have not been materially interrupted by governmental mandates, but changes in the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic at different times in the various 9Table of Contentscities and regions where we operate, or changes in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by governmental agencies may impact our ability to operate. We believe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition is uncertain, unpredictable and is outside of our control. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the nature and duration of federal, state and local laws, orders, rules, emergency temporary standards, regulations and mandates, together with protocols and contractual requirements implemented by our customers, that have been enacted or newly enforced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic (collectively, or individually, referred to herein as “COVID-19 Legal and Contractual Requirements”). Additionally, our ability to perform our work is dependent on the effectiveness of vaccination programs that are implemented in the markets in which we operate and the willingness and ability of our employees and our subcontractor’s workers to participate in these vaccination programs as required. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to heighten and exacerbate the risks described herein. In addition to those risks, and others that cannot yet be identified, we may experience impacts to our business resulting from any of the following:•The classification of our services as being essential in nature could change at any time in any or all of the state, county or municipal jurisdictions where we provide our services, and any change could materially impact our operations. For example, certain customers of the Company’s broadband reporting unit have restricted our technicians from engaging in certain revenue generating activities on third party premises, which is where a substantial portion of revenue, operating results and cash flows for this reporting unit has historically been generated.•In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our customers have modified their protocols to increase the self-installation of customer premise equipment by their subscribers. These modifications, and any additional modifications, to protocols may result in reduced customer demand for our in-home installation services, and our customers may maintain these protocols after the impacts of the pandemic have abated.•To the extent that we are required to comply with COVID-19 Legal and Contractual Requirements that do not apply to other potential employers, our employees and our subcontractor’s workers may seek employment elsewhere, which could affect our ability to perform our work on a timely basis, or at all. •Our operations may not, at times, be consistent with evolving, differing and, in some instances, conflicting COVID-19 Legal and Contractual Requirements. For example, our employees and our subcontractor’s workers may be hesitant or unwilling to comply with COVID-19 Legal and Contractual Requirements, such as vaccination requirements. A failure to comply with COVID-19 Legal and Contractual Requirements could expose us to increased risks, including sanction from governmental bodies, the termination of our contractual agreements with our customers, a reduction or elimination of the amount of work that is issued to us by our customers and costs associated with claims that we have breached the terms of our contractual arrangements with our customers, as well as fines, penalties and costs.•As a result of having shifted many of our administrative personnel to working remotely, there is an increase in the likelihood and the potential severity of information technology security risks and concerns, and an increase in our exposure to risks and costs associated with wage and hour claims.After the COVID-19 pandemic has moderated and governmental restrictions have eased, we may continue to experience adverse effects on our operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition arising out of long-term changes to the behavior of our customers, the continuation of COVID-19 Legal and Contractual Requirements or other similar measures, and from recessionary economic conditions that may persist. The challenges faced in implementing nationwide COVID-19 vaccinations, the degree to which the public is willing to be vaccinated, and the degree that vaccines are effective in preventing infection or illness over time and in connection with existing or new variants of COVID-19 may also extend the impacts on our business.Regulatory changes may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Our customers operate in regulated industries and are subject to laws and regulations that can change frequently and without notice. The adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes to the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, could cause our customers to reduce or delay spending on the services we provide, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.Technological change may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. We generate a significant majority of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. This industry has been and continues to be impacted by rapid technological change. These changes may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Further, technological change in the telecommunications industry not directly related to the services we provide may affect the ability of one or more of our customers to compete effectively, which could result in a reduction or elimination of their use of our services. Any reduction, elimination or delay of spending by one of our customers on the services we provide could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Our customer base is highly concentrated, 10Table of Contentswith our top five customers during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021, and fiscal 2020 accounting for approximately 66.2%, 74.1%, and 78.4%, of our total contract revenues, respectively. Our industry is highly competitive and the revenue we expect from an existing customer in any market could fail to be realized if competitors who offer comparable services to our customers do so on more favorable terms or have a better relationship with a customer. Additionally, the continued consolidation of the telecommunications industry could result in the loss of a customer if, as a result of a merger or acquisition involving one or more of our customers, the surviving entity chooses to use one of our competitors for the services we currently provide.The capital and operating expenditure budgets and seasonal spending patterns of our customers affect demand for our services. Generally, our customers have no obligation to assign specific amounts of work to us. Customers decide to engage us to provide services based on, among other things, the amount of capital they have available and their spending priorities. Our customers’ capital budgets may change for reasons over which we have no control. These changes may occur quickly and without advance notice. Any fluctuation in the capital or operating expenditure budgets and priorities of our customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Seasonality and adverse weather and environmental conditions affect demand for our services. Our contract revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality and are impacted by significant weather changes as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, adverse weather, which is more likely to occur with greater frequency, severity, and duration during the winter, as well as reduced daylight hours, impact our operations during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April. Additionally, extreme weather conditions or environmental conditions, such as major or extended winter storms, droughts and tornados and natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, tropical storms, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise, could also impact the demand for our services, or impact our ability to perform our services. Also, a disproportionate number of holidays fall within the fiscal quarter ending in January, which decreases the number of available workdays in this fiscal quarter. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience reduced revenue and profitability or losses during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April compared to the fiscal quarters ending in July and October.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from multi-year master service agreements and other long-term contracts which our customers may cancel at any time or may reschedule previously assigned work. The majority of our long-term contracts are cancellable by our customers with little or no advance notice and for any, or no, reason. Our customers may also have the right to cancel or remove assigned work without canceling the contract or to reschedule or modify previously assigned work. In addition, these contracts typically include a fixed term that is subject to renewal on a periodic basis. We may be unsuccessful in renewing contracts when their fixed terms expire. Our projected revenues assume that definitive work orders have been, or will be, issued by our customer, and that the work will be completed. The potential loss of work under master service agreements and other long-term contracts, or the rescheduling or modification of previously assigned work by a customer, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity, as well as any projections we provide.Our contracts contain provisions that may require us to pay damages or incur costs if we fail to meet our contractual obligations. If we do not meet our contractual obligations our customers may look to us to pay damages or pursue other remedies, including, in some instances, the payment of liquidated damages. Additionally, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or if our customer anticipates that we cannot meet our contractual obligations, our customers may, in certain circumstances, seek reimbursement from us to cover the incremental cost of having a third party complete or remediate our work. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or incur costs as a result of a failure to meet our contractual obligations. Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation, and revenues may be realized in different periods than initially reflected in our backlog. Our backlog includes the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under master services agreements and other contractual agreements with our customers. These estimates are based on, among other things, contract terms and projections regarding the timing of the services to be provided. In the case of master service agreements, backlog is calculated using the amount of work performed in the preceding 12 month period, when applicable. Backlog for newly initiated master service agreements and other long and short-term contracts is estimated using the anticipated scope of the contract and information received from the customer in the procurement process. 11Table of ContentsIn many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract. Contract revenue estimates reflected in our backlog can be subject to change due to a number of factors, including contract cancellations or changes in the amount of work we expect to be performed. In addition, contract revenues reflected in our backlog may be realized in different periods from those previously reported due to these factors as well as project accelerations or delays due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in customer spending priorities, scheduling changes, commercial issues, such as permitting, engineering revisions, job site conditions and adverse weather, and the potential adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount or timing of our backlog can also be impacted by the merger or acquisition activity of our customers. Our estimates of our customers’ requirements during a future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain estimate of the amount of, and timing of, future revenues and earnings.Our profitability is based on delivering services within the estimated costs established when we price our contracts. A significant portion of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks. Due to the fixed price nature of the tasks, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each task exceeds our original estimates, as pricing under these contracts is determined based on estimated costs established when we enter into the contracts. A variety of factors could negatively impact the actual cost we incur in performing our work, such as changes made by our customers to the scope and extent of the services that we are to provide under a contract, delays resulting from weather and the COVID-19 pandemic, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the contract, higher than expected costs of materials and labor, delays in obtaining necessary permits, under absorbed costs, and lower than anticipated productivity. An increase in costs due to any of these factors, or for other reasons, could adversely affect our results of operations.Our business is labor-intensive, and we may be unable to attract, retain and ensure the productivity of qualified employees or to pass increased labor and training costs to our customers. We are highly dependent upon our ability to employ, train, retain, and ensure the productivity of skilled personnel to operate our business. Given the highly specialized work we perform, many of our employees receive training in, and possess, specialized technical skills that are necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain and ensure the productivity of the skilled labor force necessary to operate our business. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as the general rate of employment, competition for employees possessing the skills we need, the general health and welfare of our employees, which has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the level of compensation required to hire, train and retain qualified employees. In addition, the uncertainty of contract awards and project delays can also present difficulties in appropriately sizing our skilled labor force. Furthermore, due to the fixed price nature of the tasks in our contracts, we may be unable to pass increases in labor and training costs on to our customers. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified employees or incur additional labor and training costs, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be unable to secure independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us, either of which may adversely affect our relationships with our customers or cause us to incur additional costs. We contract with independent subcontractors to manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amounts that we would otherwise expend on fixed assets and working capital. If we are unable to secure qualified independent subcontractors with adequate labor resources at a reasonable cost, or at all, we may be delayed or unable to complete our work under a contract on a timely basis, or at all, and the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by independent subcontractors. Any of these factors could negatively impact the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain customer contracts, and our relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Changes in fuel prices may increase our costs, and we may not be able to pass along increased fuel costs to our customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on events outside of our control. Most of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks and do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term. In addition, we may be unable to secure prices that reflect rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions in conjunction with our anticipated fuel purchases, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the hedges we have in place may require us to make payments to our hedge counterparties. As a result, changes in fuel prices may adversely affect our results of operations.Increases in healthcare costs could adversely affect our financial results. The costs of providing employee medical benefits have steadily increased over a number of years due to, among other things, rising healthcare costs and legislative requirements. Because of the complex nature of healthcare laws, as well as periodic healthcare reform legislation adopted by Congress, state legislatures, and municipalities, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on our healthcare costs. 12Table of ContentsContinued increases in healthcare costs or additional costs created by future health care reform laws adopted by Congress, state legislatures, or municipalities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and contract assets, which could become uncollectible. We extend credit to our customers because we perform work under contracts prior to being able to bill for that work. Deteriorating conditions in the industries we serve, bankruptcies, or financial difficulties of a customer or within the telecommunications sector generally may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. In addition, although in some instances we may have the right to file liens for certain projects we may not be successful in enforcing those liens. The failure or delay in payment by one or more of our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Fluctuations in our effective tax rate and tax liabilities may cause volatility in our financial results. We determine and provide for income taxes based on the tax laws of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the mix and level of earnings among jurisdictions could materially impact our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period. Our effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local level, or by new interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations. We are also subject to audits by various taxing authorities. An adverse outcome from an audit could unfavorably impact our effective tax rate and increase our tax liabilities. We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, reporting units are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate their fair value may be below their carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of an annual or interim test, an impairment loss is recognized.Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand, increased costs of providing our services, and the level of overall economic activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects due to changes in technology, a slowing or uncertain economy, merger or acquisition activity, a decision to allocate resources to other areas of their business, or other reasons. The profitability of reporting units may also suffer if actual costs of providing our services exceed our estimated costs established when we enter into contracts. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a small number of customers may also cause results to vary. The factors identified above may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. A write-down of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment could adversely affect our results of operations.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2022, our common stock fluctuated from a low of $63.99 per share to a high of $100.78 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;•announcements by our customers regarding their capital spending and start-up, deferral or cancellation of projects, or their mergers and acquisitions activities;•the commercialization of new technologies impacting the services that we provide to our customers; •government regulatory actions and changes in tax laws;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and •the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.13Table of ContentsIn addition, other factors, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, widespread public health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business Our operations involve activities that are often inherently dangerous and are performed at times in complex or sensitive environments. If our activities result in, or if it is alleged that our activities have resulted in,damage or destruction to the real or personal property of others, or in injury or death to others, we could be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. Our operations involve dangerous activities such as underground drilling and the use of mechanized equipment in complex situations. These activities and their effects could result in, or be alleged to have resulted in, damage to the real and personal property of others, and cause personal injury or death to third parties or our employees. In many instances our activities are performed in close proximity to other utilities which, if damaged, may result in the occurrence of catastrophic events. Additionally, we may perform our activities in environmentally sensitive locations or in locations that may be susceptible to catastrophic events, including wildfires. If our activities cause or contribute to, or are alleged to have caused or contributed to, a catastrophic event, we could be exposed to severe financial losses and reputational harm. We procure insurance coverage to cover many of these risks; however, there can be no assurance that these coverages will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that they are adequate in scope or amount to address financial losses from these risks. As a result, we could incur significant costs to defend any such allegations, defend and indemnify our customers, repair and replace assets, or to compensate third parties; reputational harm could result in the loss of future revenue generating opportunities; or we may be subject to civil and, in certain situations, criminal liabilities.Changes in the cost or availability of materials may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. For a majority of the contract services we perform, we are provided the materials necessary by our customers. Under other contracts, we supply part, or all, of the necessary materials. If we, or our customers, are unable to procure the materials necessary to the contract services we perform, or those materials are only available at undesirable prices, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. A failure, outage, or cybersecurity breach of our technology systems or those of third-party providers may adversely affect our operations and financial results. We are increasingly dependent on technology to operate our business, to engage with our customers and other third parties, and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the services we offer our customers. We use both our own information technology systems and the information technology systems and expertise of third-party service providers to manage our operations, financial reporting, and other business processes. We also use information technology systems to record, transmit, store, and protect sensitive Company, employee, and customer information. A cyber-security attack on these information technology systems may result in financial loss, including potential fines and damages for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, many of our customer contracts can be terminated if we fail to adequately protect their data. The third-party systems of our business partners on which we rely could also fail or be subject to a cybersecurity attack. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business or the delivery of services to our customers, result in potential liabilities, the termination of contracts, divert the attention of management from effectively operating our business, cause significant reputational damage, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results. We may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against cybersecurity threats or to address actual breaches or to redress problems caused by cybersecurity breaches.We have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and attacks attempting to breach our systems and other similar incidents. In November 2017, we determined that certain of our computer systems were subject to unauthorized access. Our investigation determined that documents containing Company financial information were accessed. Law enforcement authorities were notified and new security enhancements and protocols were implemented. Although these prior cybersecurity incidents have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity, there is no assurance that future threats would not cause harm to our business and our reputation, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.The loss or long-term incapacitation of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We depend on the continued and ongoing services of our executive officers and other key employees, including the senior management of our subsidiaries. In many instances, these employees have significant experience and expertise in our industry. Competition for senior management personnel is intense and we cannot be certain that any of our executive officers or other key management personnel will remain employed by us or that they will otherwise be able to provide service to us for any length of time. We do not carry “key-person” life or disability insurance on any of our employees. The loss or long-term incapacitation of any one of our executive officers or other key employees could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business.14Table of ContentsThe preparation of our financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data and, accordingly, requires the use of management’s judgment. Estimates and assumptions are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue under the cost-to-cost method of progress, job specific costs, accrued insurance claims, the allowance for doubtful accounts, accruals for contingencies, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, the fair value of reporting units for the goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, and income taxes. When made, we believe that such estimates and assumptions are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, and such differences may be material to our financial statements.Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Our failure to comply with occupational health and workplace safety requirements could result in significant liabilities or enforcement actions and adversely impact our ability to perform services for our customers. Our operations are subject to strict laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery, work within the vicinity of high voltage lines, and engage in other potentially dangerous activities which could subject them and others to injury or death. If, in the course of our operations, it is determined we have violated safety regulations, our operations may be disrupted and we may be subject to penalties, fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, if our safety performance were to deteriorate, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to comply with immigration laws could result in significant liabilities and harm our reputation with our customers, as well as cause disruption to our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws our operations may be disrupted, and we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, many of our customer contracts specifically require compliance with immigration laws and in some cases our customers audit compliance with these laws. Further, several of our customers require that we ensure our subcontractors comply with these laws with respect to the workers that perform services for them. A failure to comply with these laws could damage our reputation and may result in the cancellation of our contracts by our customers, or a decision by our customers not to award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to comply with various laws and regulations related to contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles could result in significant liabilities. We are subject to a number of state and federal laws and regulations, including those related to contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations, we may be unable to perform services for our customers and may also be subject to fines, penalties, and the suspension or revocation of our licenses. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may affect our ability to operate and could require us to incur significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations.Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers and we often operate in close proximity to pipelines or underground storage tanks that may contain hazardous substances. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event that we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations or if we cause or are responsible for the release of hazardous substances or other environmental damages. These liabilities could result in significant costs including remediation costs, fines, third-party claims for property damage, loss of use, or personal injury, and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. These costs as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new remediation requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance-related liabilities. Within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), environmental liability, workers’ compensation, and employee group health. We are effectively self-insured for the majority of claims because most claims against us fall below the deductibles under our insurance policies. Additionally, within our aggregate coverage limits and above our base layer of third-party insurance coverage, we have retained 15Table of Contentsthe risk of loss at certain levels of exposure and any claims that reach these retained levels of exposure are self-insured. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances, and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors not known at the time such estimates are made. These factors include the estimated development of claims, the payment pattern of claims incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions, and court interpretations. Should the cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 10, Accrued Insurance Claims, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may be subject to litigation, indemnity claims, and other disputes, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. From time to time, we are subject to lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, and other claims brought or threatened against us by third parties, including our customers. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, liquidated damages, consequential damages, punitive damages, statutory damages, and civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we may also be subject to class action lawsuits, including those alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, state and municipal wage and hour laws, and misclassification of independent contractors. We also indemnify our customers for claims arising out of or related to the services we provide and our actions or omissions under our contracts. In some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for the actions or omissions of our customers, subcontractors, or other third parties.Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution proceedings, we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Class action lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts. Accordingly, the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of any litigation or proceeding through settlement, mediation, or a judgment could have a material impact on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may be subject to warranty claims, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. We typically warrant the services we provide by guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and materials. When warranty claims occur, we may be required to repair or replace warrantied items without receiving any additional compensation. Our performance of warranty services requires us to allocate resources that otherwise might be engaged in the provision of services that generate revenue. In addition, our customers often have the right to repair or replace warrantied items using the services of another provider and to charge the cost of the repair or replacement to us. Costs incurred for warranty claims, or reductions to revenue-generating activities arising from the allocation of resources to resolve warranty claims, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.One of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans under which we could incur significant liabilities. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, one of our subsidiaries participates in various multiemployer pension plans that provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to participants. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to providing benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), absent an applicable exemption, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon withdrawal from the plan for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liability. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate become significantly underfunded, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions in the form of higher contribution rates or surcharges. This could occur because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on plan assets, or other funding deficiencies. Requirements to pay increased contributions or a withdrawal liability could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, one of the Company’s subsidiaries ceased operations. This subsidiary contributed to a multiemployer pension plan, the Pension, Hospitalization and Benefit Plan of the Electrical Industry - Pension Trust Fund 16Table of Contents(the “Plan”). In October 2016, the Plan demanded payment for a claimed withdrawal liability of approximately $13.0 million. In December 2016, the subsidiary submitted a formal request to the Plan seeking review of the Plan’s withdrawal liability determination. The subsidiary disputes the claim that it is required to make payment of a withdrawal liability as demanded by the Plan as it believes that a statutory exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) applies to its activities. The Plan has taken the position that the work at issue does not qualify for that statutory exemption. The subsidiary has submitted this dispute to arbitration, as required by ERISA. There can be no assurance that the Company’s subsidiary will be successful in asserting the statutory exemption as a defense in the arbitration proceeding. As required by ERISA, in November 2016, this subsidiary began making payments of a withdrawal liability to the Plan in the amount of approximately $0.1 million per month. If the subsidiary prevails in disputing the withdrawal liability, all such payments are expected to be refunded. Given the early stage of this action, it is not possible to estimate a range of loss that could result from either an adverse judgment or a settlement of this matter.Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our Company or a change in our control. We are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control. In addition, certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to elect approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders. As a result, our shareholders may be unable to take advantage of opportunities to dispose of their stock in the Company at higher prices that may otherwise be available in connection with takeover attempts or under a merger or other proposal.We may face challenges in setting and meeting our corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals. We have begun to assess and develop corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals for our company. Our customers, shareholders, and other constituents may be not be satisfied with the progress we have made in setting corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals, particularly as it relates to reducing the environmental impact of our business operations. Any targets or goals we do set will be subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which may be outside of our control, and it is possible that we may fail to achieve any goals and targets we do set. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: our ability to execute our operational strategies and achieve our goals; the availability of new technologies and equipment that operates on these technologies on a cost effective basis; overlapping and contradictory requirements and scoring relating to goals; the inability to effectively impose requirements on our suppliers and subcontractors; and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures. A failure to set meaningful corporate social responsibility and sustainability goals for our company or our failure to meet these goals in the future could adversely affect public perception of our business or customer or shareholder support.Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our BusinessWe may not have access in the future to sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to pursue acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, and for working capital needs, or to respond to changing business conditions. Our existing credit agreement contains significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt. In addition, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to access additional capital could adversely affect our liquidity and may limit our growth and ability to execute our business strategy.Our debt obligations impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility, and a failure to comply with these obligations could result in the acceleration of our debt. On April 1, 2021, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries amended its credit agreement, dated as of October 19, 2018, with the various lenders party thereto and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent (the “Credit Agreement”) to among other things, decrease the maximum revolver commitment to $650.0 million from $750.0 million and decrease the term loan facility to $350.0 million from $416.3 million. The Credit Agreement includes a $200.0 million sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit and a $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. As part of the amendment, the maturity of the Credit Agreement was extended to April 1, 2026. As of January 29, 2022, we had $350.0 million outstanding under the term loan facility and $46.3 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our Credit Agreement. We had no outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility as of January 29, 2022. This Credit Agreement contains covenants that restrict or limit our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make investments or 17Table of Contentscreate liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell certain assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. Our Credit Agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. These covenants in our Credit Agreement may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us and may limit our flexibility in the execution of our business strategy. On April 1, 2021, we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.50% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). The 2029 Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by all of our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the Credit Agreement. The indenture governing the 2029 Notes includes cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions with our Credit Agreement. If our financial results fall below anticipated levels, we may be unable to comply with these covenants and a default under our credit agreement could result in the acceleration of our obligations under both our credit agreement and the indenture governing the 2029 Notes, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business strategy.The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous local and regional providers, as well as several large multinational corporations that may have financial, technical, and marketing resources exceeding ours. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. Any organization may become a competitor if it has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise, the ability to engage subcontractors, and the necessary equipment and materials. Additionally, our competitors may develop expertise, experience, and resources to provide services that are equal or superior to our services in price, quality, or availability, and we may be unable to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of our contracts upon the expiration of their terms. If competitors underbid us to procure business, we could be required to lower the prices we charge in order to retain contracts. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our customers shift a significant portion of our work to a competitor, if we are unsuccessful in bidding or retaining projects, or if our ability to win projects requires us to provide our services at reduced margins.We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers. We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform a portion of the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our existing or prospective customers reduce the specialty contracting services that are outsourced to us. Our failure to perform sufficient due diligence prior to completing acquisitions could result in significant liabilities. The growth of our business through acquisitions may expose us to risks, including the failure to identify significant issues and risks of an acquired business. A failure to identify or appropriately quantify a liability in our due diligence process could result in the assumption of unanticipated liabilities arising from the prior operations of an acquired business, some of which may not be adequately reserved and may not be covered by indemnification obligations. The assumption of unknown liabilities due to a failure of our due diligence could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our financial results. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. The success of this strategy depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing operations and elimination of redundant costs. To realize these benefits, we must successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations. Integrating acquired businesses involves a number of operational challenges and risks, including diversion of management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications, and other systems and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company; and failure to retain management and other key employees. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position"
2,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2021-03-05,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.9Table of ContentsRisks Related to Financial Performance or General Economic ConditionsEconomic downturns, uncertain economic conditions, and capital market fluctuations may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. During an economic downturn, or when uncertainty regarding current or future economic conditions is elevated, our customers may reduce or eliminate their spending on the services we provide. In addition, volatility in the debt or equity markets may impact our customers’ access to capital and result in the reduction or elimination of spending on the services we provide. These conditions, which can develop rapidly, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our operations and is expected to continue to pose risks that could materially disrupt our business and negatively impact our operating results, cash flows and financial condition. The economy of the United States has been severely impacted by the nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Measures taken include travel restrictions, social distancing requirements, quarantines, and shelter in place orders. As a result, businesses have been closed and certain business activities curtailed or modified. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our services have generally been considered essential in nature and have not been materially interrupted, but changes in the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic at different times in the various cities and regions where we operate could impact our ability to operate in the future.We believe the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operating results, cash flows and financial condition is uncertain, unpredictable and may be outside of our control. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on the severity and duration of the pandemic and the extent and the effectiveness of federal, state and local actions taken in response to the pandemic including the effectiveness of vaccination programs that are implemented in the markets in which we operate. The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to heighten and exacerbate the risks identified herein. In addition to those risks and others that cannot yet be identified, we may experience impacts to our business resulting from any the following:•The classification of our services as being essential in nature could change at any time in any or all of the state, county or municipal jurisdictions where we provide our services, and any change could materially impact our operations. For example, certain customers of one of the Company’s reporting units (“Broadband”) have restricted our technicians from engaging in certain revenue generating activities on third party premises, which is where Broadband has historically generated a substantial portion of its revenue, operating results and cash flows.•In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our customers have modified their protocols to increase the self-installation of customer premise equipment by their subscribers. These modifications and any additional modifications to protocols are expected to result in a downturn in customer demand for our in-home installation services for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and certain of our customers may maintain the current levels of self-installation even after the impacts of the pandemic have abated.•Our operations may not, at times, function in a manner that is consistent with evolving, differing and, in some instances, conflicting guidelines and best practices that are intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19, which could expose us to increased risks and costs associated with workplace safety claims.•As a result of having temporarily shifted many of our administrative personnel to working remotely, there is an increase in the likelihood and the potential severity of information technology security risks and concerns, and an increase in our exposure to risks and costs associated with wage and hour claims.After the COVID-19 pandemic has moderated and governmental restrictions have eased, we may continue to experience adverse effects on our operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition arising out of long-term changes to the behavior of our customers and from recessionary economic conditions that may persist. The challenges faced in implementing nationwide COVID-19 vaccinations, the degree to which the public is willing to be vaccinated, and the degree that vaccines are effective in preventing infection or illness in connection with existing or new strains of COVID-19 may also extend the impacts on our business.Regulatory changes may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Our customers operate in regulated industries and are subject to laws and regulations that can change frequently and without notice. The adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes to the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, could cause our customers to reduce or delay spending on the services we provide, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.Technological change may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. We generate a significant majority of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. This industry has been and continues to be impacted by rapid technological change. These changes may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Further, technological change in the telecommunications industry not directly related to the services we provide may affect the ability of one or more of our customers to compete effectively, which could result in a reduction or elimination of their use of our services. Any reduction, elimination or delay of spending by one of our customers on the services we provide could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. 10Table of ContentsWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers during fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019 for approximately 74.1%, 78.4%, and 78.4%, of our total contract revenues, respectively. Our industry is highly competitive and the revenue we expect from an existing customer in any market could fail to be realized if competitors who offer comparable services to our customers do so on more favorable terms or have a better relationship with a customer. Additionally, the continued consolidation of the telecommunications industry could result in the loss of a customer if, as a result of a merger or acquisition involving one or more of our customers, the surviving entity chooses to use one of our competitors for the services we currently provide. On February 25, 2019, Windstream, our fifth largest customer with contract revenues of $113.6 million during fiscal 2019, filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. Windstream emerged from bankruptcy in September 2020. The loss of a significant customer, or reduction in services performed for a significant customer, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. The capital and operating expenditure budgets and seasonal spending patterns of our customers affect demand for our services. Generally, our customers have no obligation to assign specific amounts of work to us. Customers decide to engage us to provide services based on, among other things, the amount of capital they have available and their spending priorities. Our customers’ capital budgets may change for reasons over which we have no control. These changes may occur quickly and without advance notice. Any fluctuation in the capital or operating expenditure budgets and priorities of our customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Seasonality affects demand for our services. Our contract revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, adverse weather, which is more likely to occur with greater frequency, severity, and duration during the winter, as well as reduced daylight hours, impact our operations during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April. In addition, a disproportionate number of holidays fall within the fiscal quarter ending in January, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience reduced revenue and profitability or losses during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April compared to the fiscal quarters ending in July and October.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from multi-year master service agreements and other long-term contracts which our customers may cancel at any time or may reschedule previously assigned work. The majority of our long-term contracts are cancellable by our customers with little or no advance notice and for any, or no, reason. Our customers may also have the right to cancel or remove assigned work without canceling the contract or to reschedule or modify previously assigned work. In addition, these contracts typically include a fixed term that is subject to renewal on a periodic basis. We may be unsuccessful in renewing contracts when their fixed terms expire. Our projected revenues assume that definitive work orders have been, or will be, issued by our customer, and that the work will be completed. The potential loss of work under master service agreements and other long-term contracts, or the rescheduling or modification of previously assigned work by a customer, could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity, as well as any projections we provide.Our contracts contain provisions that may require us to pay damages or incur costs if we fail to meet our contractual obligations. If we do not meet our contractual obligations our customers may look to us to pay damages or pursue other remedies, including, in some instances, the payment of liquidated damages. Additionally, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or if our customer anticipates that we cannot meet our contractual obligations, our customers may, in certain circumstances, seek reimbursement from us to cover the incremental cost of having a third party complete or remediate our work. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or incur costs as a result of a failure to meet our contractual obligations. Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation, and revenues may be realized in different periods than initially reflected in our backlog. Our backlog includes the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under master services agreements and other contractual agreements with our customers. These estimates are based on, among other things, contract terms and projections regarding the timing of the services to be provided. In the case of master service agreements, backlog is calculated using the amount of work performed in the preceding 12 month period, when applicable. Backlog for newly initiated master service agreements and other long and short-term contracts is estimated using the anticipated scope of the contract and information received from the customer in the procurement process. 11Table of ContentsIn many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract. Contract revenue estimates reflected in our backlog can be subject to change due to a number of factors, including contract cancellations or changes in the amount of work we expect to be performed. In addition, contract revenues reflected in our backlog may be realized in different periods from those previously reported due to these factors as well as project accelerations or delays due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, changes in customer spending priorities, scheduling changes, commercial issues, such as permitting, engineering revisions, job site conditions and adverse weather, and the potential adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The amount or timing of our backlog can also be impacted by the merger or acquisition activity of our customers. Our estimates of our customers’ requirements during a future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain estimate of the amount of, and timing of, future revenues and earnings.Our profitability is based on delivering services within the estimated costs established when we price our contracts. A significant portion of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks. Due to the fixed price nature of the tasks, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each task exceeds our original estimates, as pricing under these contracts is determined based on estimated costs established when we enter into the contracts. A variety of factors could negatively impact the actual cost we incur in performing our work, such as changes made by our customers to the scope and extent of the services that we are to provide under a contract, delays resulting from weather and the COVID-19 pandemic, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the contract, higher than expected costs of materials and labor, delays in obtaining necessary permits, under absorbed costs, and lower than anticipated productivity. An increase in costs due to any of these factors, or for other reasons, could adversely affect our results of operations.Our business is labor-intensive, and we may be unable to attract, retain and ensure the productivity of qualified employees or to pass increased labor and training costs to our customers. We are highly dependent upon our ability to employ, train, retain, and ensure the productivity of skilled personnel to operate our business. Given the highly specialized work we perform, many of our employees receive training in, and possess, specialized technical skills that are necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain and ensure the productivity of the skilled labor force necessary to operate our business. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as the general rate of employment, competition for employees possessing the skills we need, the general health and welfare of our employees, which has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the level of compensation required to hire, train and retain qualified employees. In addition, the uncertainty of contract awards and project delays can also present difficulties in appropriately sizing our skilled labor force. Furthermore, due to the fixed price nature of the tasks in our contracts, we may be unable to pass increases in labor and training costs on to our customers. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified employees or incur additional labor and training costs, our results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be unable to secure independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us, either of which may adversely affect our relationships with our customers or cause us to incur additional costs. We contract with independent subcontractors to manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amounts that we would otherwise expend on fixed assets and working capital. If we are unable to secure qualified independent subcontractors with adequate labor resources at a reasonable cost, or at all, we may be delayed or unable to complete our work under a contract on a timely basis, or at all, and the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by independent subcontractors. Any of these factors could negatively impact the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain customer contracts, and our relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Changes in fuel prices may increase our costs, and we may not be able to pass along increased fuel costs to our customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on events outside of our control. Most of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks and do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term. In addition, we may be unable to secure prices that reflect rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions in conjunction with our anticipated fuel purchases, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the hedges we have in place may require us to make payments to our hedge counterparties. As a result, changes in fuel prices may adversely affect our results of operations.Increases in healthcare costs could adversely affect our financial results. The costs of providing employee medical benefits have steadily increased over a number of years due to, among other things, rising healthcare costs and legislative requirements. Because of the complex nature of healthcare laws, as well as periodic healthcare reform legislation adopted by Congress, state legislatures, and municipalities, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on our healthcare costs. 12Table of ContentsContinued increases in healthcare costs or additional costs created by future health care reform laws adopted by Congress, state legislatures, or municipalities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and contract assets, which could become uncollectible. We extend credit to our customers because we perform work under contracts prior to being able to bill for that work. Deteriorating conditions in the industries we serve, bankruptcies, or financial difficulties of a customer or within the telecommunications sector generally may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. In addition, although in some instances we may have the right to file liens for certain projects we may not be successful in enforcing those liens. The failure or delay in payment by one or more of our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. On February 25, 2019, Windstream filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. As of January 26, 2019, the Company had outstanding receivables and contract assets in aggregate of approximately $45.0 million. Against this amount, we recorded a non-cash charge of $17.2 million reflecting our evaluation of recoverability of these receivables and contract assets as of January 26, 2019. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we recovered $10.3 million of these previously reserved accounts receivable and contract assets. Windstream emerged from bankruptcy in September 2020.Fluctuations in our effective tax rate and tax liabilities may cause volatility in our financial results. We determine and provide for income taxes based on the tax laws of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the mix and level of earnings among jurisdictions could materially impact our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period. Our effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local level, or by new interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations. In particular with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (“FFCR Act”) and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) were signed into law on March 17, 2020 and on March 27, 2020, collectively the “Stimulus Bills.” The Stimulus Bills include tax provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, the deferral of employer’s social security payments, and modifications to net operating loss (“NOL”) carryback provisions. During fiscal 2021, we recognized an income tax benefit of $2.6 million from a tax loss carryback technical correction under the CARES Act. Also in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (“CA Act”) was signed into law on December 27, 2020, including an extension of certain expiring tax provisions. Our interpretations of the provisions within the Stimulus Bills could differ from future interpretations and guidance from the U.S Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other regulatory agencies, including state taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also subject to audits by various taxing authorities. An adverse outcome from an audit could unfavorably impact our effective tax rate and increase our tax liabilities. We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, reporting units are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate their fair value may be below their carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of an annual or interim test, an impairment loss is recognized.Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand, increased costs of providing our services, and the level of overall economic activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects due to changes in technology, a slowing or uncertain economy, merger or acquisition activity, a decision to allocate resources to other areas of their business, or other reasons. The profitability of reporting units may also suffer if actual costs of providing our services exceed our estimated costs established when we enter into contracts. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a small number of customers may also cause results to vary. The factors identified above may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. A write-down of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment could adversely affect our results of operations.Conversion of our Notes or exercise of the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. In September 2015, we issued 0.75% convertible senior notes due September 2021 (the “Notes”), and at January 30, 2021, $58.3 million aggregate principal amount of Notes remain outstanding. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties. These hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlay the Notes sold in the offering. We also entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge 13Table of Contentscounterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution. At our election, we may settle the Notes tendered for conversion entirely or partly in shares of our common stock. Further, the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions may be settled on a net-share basis. As a result, the conversion of some or all of the Notes or the exercise of some or all of such warrants may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion of the Notes or such exercise of the warrants could adversely affect the then-prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.Our convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions may affect our common stock. The hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions with respect to the Note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions from time to time. They may do so by purchasing and/or selling shares of our common stock and/or other securities of ours, including the Notes, in privately negotiated transactions and/or open-market transactions or by entering into and/or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The hedge counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes or following any repurchase of the Notes by us on any fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) repurchase date. The effect, if any, of these transactions on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and lead to increased volatility in transactions involving our common stock. In addition, there may be no visibility with respect to transactions involving the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates, and those parties may choose to engage in, or to discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be at their sole discretion and not within our control.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the Note hedge transactions. We are subject to the risk that the financial institutions that are counterparties to the Note hedge transactions could default under the Note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties is unsecured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in failure or financial difficulties for many financial institutions. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any hedge counterparty.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2021, our common stock fluctuated from a low of $13.49 per share to a high of $89.88 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;•announcements by our customers regarding their capital spending and start-up, deferral or cancellation of projects, or their mergers and acquisitions activities;•the commercialization of new technologies impacting the services that we provide to our customers; •government regulatory actions and changes in tax laws;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and •the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.In addition, other factors, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, widespread public health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Risks Related to the Operation of Our Business Our operations involve activities that are often inherently dangerous and are performed at times in complex or sensitive environments. If our activities result, or if it is alleged that our activities have resulted in, in damage or destruction to the real or personal property of others, or in injury or death to others, we could be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. Our operations involve dangerous activities such as underground drilling and the use of mechanized equipment in complex situations. These activities and their effects could result in, or be 14Table of Contentsalleged to have resulted in, damage to the real and personal property of others, and cause personal injury or death to third parties or our employees. In many instances our activities are performed in close proximity to other utilities which, if damaged, may result in the occurrence of catastrophic events. Additionally, we may perform our activities in environmentally sensitive locations or in locations that may be susceptible to catastrophic events, including wildfires. If our activities cause or contribute to, or are alleged to have caused or contributed to, a catastrophic event, we could be exposed to severe financial losses and reputational harm. We procure insurance coverage to cover many of these risks; however, there can be no assurance that these coverages will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that they are adequate in scope or amount to address financial losses from these risks. As a result, we could incur significant costs to defend any such allegations, defend and indemnify our customers, repair and replace assets, or to compensate third parties; reputational harm could result in the loss of future revenue generating opportunities; or we may be subject to civil and, in certain situations, criminal liabilities.Changes in the cost or availability of materials may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. For a majority of the contract services we perform, we are provided the materials necessary by our customers. Under other contracts, we supply part, or all, of the necessary materials. If we, or our customers, are unable to procure the materials necessary to the contract services we perform, or those materials are only available at undesirable prices, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. A failure, outage, or cybersecurity breach of our technology systems or those of third-party providers may adversely affect our operations and financial results. We are increasingly dependent on technology to operate our business, to engage with our customers and other third parties, and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the services we offer our customers. We use both our own information technology systems and the information technology systems and expertise of third-party service providers to manage our operations, financial reporting, and other business processes. We also use information technology systems to record, transmit, store, and protect sensitive Company, employee, and customer information. A cyber-security attack on these information technology systems may result in financial loss, including potential fines and damages for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, many of our customer contracts can be terminated if we fail to adequately protect their data. The third-party systems of our business partners on which we rely could also fail or be subject to a cybersecurity attack. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business or the delivery of services to our customers, result in potential liabilities, the termination of contracts, divert the attention of management from effectively operating our business, cause significant reputational damage, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results. We may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against cybersecurity threats or to address actual breaches or to redress problems caused by cybersecurity breaches.We have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and attacks attempting to breach our systems and other similar incidents. In November 2017, we determined that certain of our computer systems were subject to unauthorized access. Our investigation determined that documents containing Company financial information were accessed. Law enforcement authorities were notified and new security enhancements and protocols were implemented. Although these prior cybersecurity incidents have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity, there is no assurance that future threats would not cause harm to our business and our reputation, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.The loss or long-term incapacitation of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We depend on the continued and ongoing services of our executive officers and other key employees, including the senior management of our subsidiaries. In many instances, these employees have significant experience and expertise in our industry. Competition for senior management personnel is intense and we cannot be certain that any of our executive officers or other key management personnel will remain employed by us or that they will otherwise be able to provide service to us for any length of time. We do not carry “key-person” life or disability insurance on any of our employees. The loss or long-term incapacitation of any one of our executive officers or other key employees could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business.The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data and, accordingly, requires the use of management’s judgment. Estimates and assumptions are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue under the cost-to-cost method of progress, job specific costs, accrued insurance claims, the allowance for doubtful accounts, accruals for contingencies, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, the fair value of reporting units for the goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, the purchase price allocations of businesses 15Table of Contentsacquired, and income taxes. When made, we believe that such estimates and assumptions are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, and such differences may be material to our financial statements.Risks Related to Laws and Regulations Our failure to comply with occupational health and workplace safety requirements could result in significant liabilities or enforcement actions and adversely impact our ability to perform services for our customers. Our operations are subject to strict laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery, work within the vicinity of high voltage lines, and engage in other potentially dangerous activities which could subject them and others to injury or death. If, in the course of our operations, it is determined we have violated safety regulations, our operations may be disrupted and we may be subject to penalties, fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, if our safety performance were to deteriorate, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to comply with immigration laws could result in significant liabilities and harm our reputation with our customers, as well as cause disruption to our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws our operations may be disrupted, and we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, many of our customer contracts specifically require compliance with immigration laws and in some cases our customers audit compliance with these laws. Further, several of our customers require that we ensure our subcontractors comply with these laws with respect to the workers that perform services for them. A failure to comply with these laws could damage our reputation and may result in the cancellation of our contracts by our customers, or a decision by our customers not to award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to comply with various laws and regulations related to contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles could result in significant liabilities. We are subject to a number of state and federal laws and regulations, including those related to contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations, we may be unable to perform services for our customers and may also be subject to fines, penalties, and the suspension or revocation of our licenses. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may affect our ability to operate and could require us to incur significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations.Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers and we often operate in close proximity to pipelines or underground storage tanks that may contain hazardous substances. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event that we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations or if we cause or are responsible for the release of hazardous substances or other environmental damages. These liabilities could result in significant costs including remediation costs, fines, third-party claims for property damage, loss of use, or personal injury, and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. These costs as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new remediation requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance-related liabilities. Within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), environmental liability, workers’ compensation, and employee group health. We are effectively self-insured for the majority of claims because most claims against us fall below the deductibles under our insurance policies. Additionally, within our aggregate coverage limits and above our base layer of third-party insurance coverage, we have retained the risk of loss at certain levels of exposure and any claims that reach these retained levels of exposure are self-insured. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances, and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors not known at the time such estimates are made. These factors include the estimated development of claims, the payment pattern of claims incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions, and court interpretations. Should the cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 11, Accrued Insurance Claims, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 16Table of ContentsWe may be subject to litigation, indemnity claims, and other disputes, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. From time to time, we are subject to lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, and other claims brought or threatened against us by third parties, including our customers. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, liquidated damages, consequential damages, punitive damages and civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we may also be subject to class action lawsuits, including those alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, state and municipal wage and hour laws, and misclassification of independent contractors. We also indemnify our customers for claims arising out of or related to the services we provide and our actions or omissions under our contracts. In some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for the actions or omissions of our customers, subcontractors, or other third parties.Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution proceedings, we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Class action lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts. Accordingly, the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of any litigation or proceeding through settlement, mediation, or a judgment could have a material impact on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may be subject to warranty claims, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. We typically warrant the services we provide by guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and materials. When warranty claims occur, we may be required to repair or replace warrantied items without receiving any additional compensation. Our performance of warranty services requires us to allocate resources that otherwise might be engaged in the provision of services that generate revenue. In addition, our customers often have the right to repair or replace warrantied items using the services of another provider and to charge the cost of the repair or replacement to us. Costs incurred for warranty claims, or reductions to revenue-generating activities arising from the allocation of resources to resolve warranty claims, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Several of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans under which we could incur significant liabilities. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, several of our subsidiaries participate in various multiemployer pension plans that provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to participants. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to providing benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), absent an applicable exemption, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon withdrawal from the plan for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liability. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate become significantly underfunded, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions in the form of higher contribution rates or surcharges. This could occur because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on plan assets, or other funding deficiencies. Requirements to pay increased contributions or a withdrawal liability could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, one of the Company’s subsidiaries ceased operations. This subsidiary contributed to a multiemployer pension plan, the Pension, Hospitalization and Benefit Plan of the Electrical Industry - Pension Trust Fund (the “Plan”). In October 2016, the Plan demanded payment for a claimed withdrawal liability of approximately $13.0 million. In December 2016, the subsidiary submitted a formal request to the Plan seeking review of the Plan’s withdrawal liability determination. The subsidiary disputes the claim that it is required to make payment of a withdrawal liability as demanded by the Plan as it believes that a statutory exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) applies to its activities. The Plan has taken the position that the work at issue does not qualify for that statutory exemption. The subsidiary has submitted this dispute to arbitration, as required by ERISA. There can be no assurance that the Company’s subsidiary will be successful in asserting the statutory exemption as a defense in the arbitration proceeding. As required by ERISA, in November 2016, this subsidiary began making payments of a withdrawal liability to the Plan in the amount of approximately $0.1 million per month. If the subsidiary prevails in disputing the withdrawal liability, all such payments are expected to be refunded. Given the early stage of this action, it is not possible to estimate a range of loss that could result from either an adverse judgment or a settlement of this matter.17Table of ContentsAnti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our Company or a change in our control. We are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control. In addition, certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to elect approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders. As a result, our shareholders may be unable to take advantage of opportunities to dispose of their stock in the Company at higher prices that may otherwise be available in connection with takeover attempts or under a merger or other proposal.Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our BusinessWe may not have access in the future to sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to pursue acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, and for working capital needs, or to respond to changing business conditions. Our existing credit agreement contains significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt. In addition, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to access additional capital could adversely affect our liquidity and may limit our growth and ability to execute our business strategy.Our debt obligations impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility, and a failure to comply with these obligations could result in the acceleration of our debt. We have a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $750.0 million revolving facility, $450.0 million in aggregate term loan facility, and contains a sublimit of $200.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. As of January 30, 2021, we had $421.9 million outstanding under the term loans and $52.2 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our credit agreement. We had $105.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility as of January 30, 2021. This credit agreement contains covenants that restrict or limit our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make investments or create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell certain assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. Our credit agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. These covenants in our credit agreement may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us and may limit our flexibility in the execution of our business strategy. Additionally, the indenture governing the Notes includes cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions with our bank credit facility. If our financial results fall below anticipated levels, we may be unable to comply with these covenants and a default under our credit agreement could result in the acceleration of our obligations under both our credit agreement and the indenture governing the Notes, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business strategy.The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous local and regional providers, as well as several large multinational corporations that may have financial, technical, and marketing resources exceeding ours. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. Any organization may become a competitor if it has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise, the ability to engage subcontractors, and the necessary equipment and materials. Additionally, our competitors may develop expertise, experience, and resources to provide services that are equal or superior to our services in price, quality, or availability, and we may be unable to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of our contracts upon the expiration of their terms. If competitors underbid us to procure business, we could be required to lower the prices we charge in order to retain contracts. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our customers shift a significant portion of our work to a competitor, if we are unsuccessful in bidding or retaining projects, or if our ability to win projects requires us to provide our services at reduced margins.We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers. We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform a portion of the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our existing or prospective customers reduce the specialty contracting services that are outsourced to us. 18Table of ContentsOur failure to perform sufficient due diligence prior to completing acquisitions could result in significant liabilities. The growth of our business through acquisitions may expose us to risks, including the failure to identify significant issues and risks of an acquired business. A failure to identify or appropriately quantify a liability in our due diligence process could result in the assumption of unanticipated liabilities arising from the prior operations of an acquired business, some of which may not be adequately reserved and may not be covered by indemnification obligations. The assumption of unknown liabilities due to a failure of our due diligence could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our financial results. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. The success of this strategy depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing operations and elimination of redundant costs. To realize these benefits, we must successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations. Integrating acquired businesses involves a number of operational challenges and risks, including diversion of management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications, and other systems and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company; and failure to retain management and other key employees. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position"
6,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2020-03-02,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.Economic downturns, uncertain economic conditions, and capital market fluctuations may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. During an economic downturn, or when uncertainty regarding current or future economic conditions is elevated, our customers may reduce or eliminate their spending on the services we provide. In addition, volatility in the debt or equity markets may impact our customers’ access to capital and result in the reduction or elimination of spending on the services we provide. These conditions, which can develop rapidly, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.Regulatory changes may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Our customers operate in regulated industries and are subject to regulations that can change frequently and without notice. The adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes to the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, could cause our customers to reduce spending on the services we provide, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.  Technological change may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. We generate a significant majority of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. This industry has been and continues to be impacted by rapid technological change. These changes may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Further, technological change in the telecommunications industry not directly related to the services we provide may affect the ability of one or more of our customers to compete effectively, which could result in a reduction or elimination of their use of our services. Any reduction or elimination of spending by one of our customers on the services we provide could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers during fiscal 2020, fiscal 2019, the 2018 transition period, and fiscal 2017 accounting for approximately 78.4%, 78.4%, 75.8%, and 76.8% of our total contract revenues, respectively. Our industry is highly competitive and the revenue we expect from an existing customer in any market could fail to be realized if competitors who offer comparable services to our customers do so on more favorable terms or have a better relationship with a customer. Additionally, the continued consolidation of the telecommunications industry could result in the loss of a customer if, as a result of a merger or acquisition involving one or more of our customers, the surviving entity chooses to use one of our competitors for the services we currently provide. On February 25, 2019, Windstream, our fifth largest customer with contract revenues of $113.6 million during fiscal 2019, filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. We expect to continue to provide services to Windstream pursuant to existing contractual obligations but the amount of services performed in the future could be reduced or eliminated. The loss of a significant customer, or reduction in services performed for a significant customer, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. The capital and operating expenditure budgets and seasonal spending patterns of our customers affect demand for our services. Generally, our customers have no obligation to assign specific amounts of work to us. Customers decide to engage us to provide services based on, among other things, the amount of capital they have available and their spending priorities. Our customers’ capital budgets may change for reasons over which we have no control. These changes may occur quickly and without advance notice. Any fluctuation in the capital or operating expenditure budgets and priorities of our customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Seasonality affects demand for our services. Our revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, adverse weather, which is more likely to occur with greater frequency, severity, and duration during the winter, as well as reduced daylight hours, impact our operations during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April. The effect of weather delays on our projects may be significant if we are unable to adjust the project schedule for such delays. In addition, a disproportionate number of holidays fall within the fiscal quarter ending in January, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience reduced 9Table of Contentsrevenue and profitability or losses during our fiscal quarters ending in January and April compared to our fiscal quarters ending in July and October. The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous local and regional providers, as well as several large multinational corporations that may have financial, technical, and marketing resources exceeding ours. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. Any organization may become a competitor if it has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise, the ability to engage subcontractors, and the necessary equipment and materials. Additionally, our competitors may develop expertise, experience, and resources to provide services that are equal or superior to our services in price, quality, or availability, and we may be unable to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of our contracts upon the expiration of their terms. If competitors underbid us to procure business, we could be required to lower the prices we charge in order to retain contracts. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our customers shift a significant portion of our work to a competitor, if we are unsuccessful in bidding or retaining projects, or if our ability to win projects requires us to provide our services at reduced margins.We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers. We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform a portion of the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our existing or prospective customers reduce the specialty contracting services that are outsourced to us. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from multi-year master service agreements and other long-term contracts which our customers may cancel at any time or may reschedule previously assigned work. The majority of our long-term contracts are cancellable by our customers with little or no advance notice and for any, or no, reason. Our customers may also have the right to cancel or remove assigned work without canceling the contract or to reschedule or modify previously assigned work. In addition, these contracts typically include a fixed term that is subject to renewal on a periodic basis. We may be unsuccessful in renewing contracts when their fixed terms expire. Our projected revenues assume that definitive work orders have been, or will be issued by our customer, and that the work will be completed. The potential loss of work under master service agreements and other long-term contracts, or the rescheduling or modification of previously assigned work by a customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity, as well as any projections we provide.Our contracts contain provisions that may require us to pay damages or incur costs if we fail to meet our contractual obligations. If we do not meet our contractual obligations our customers may look to us to pay damages or pursue other remedies, including, in some instances, the payment of liquidated damages. Additionally, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or if our customer anticipates that we cannot meet our contractual obligations, our customers may, in certain circumstances, seek reimbursement from us to cover the incremental cost of having a third party complete or remediate our work. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or incur costs as a result of a failure to meet our contractual obligations. Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation, and revenues may be realized in different periods than initially reflected in our backlog. Our backlog includes the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under master services agreements and other contractual agreements with our customers. These estimates are based on contract terms and evaluations regarding the timing of the services to be provided. In the case of master service agreements, backlog is calculated using the amount of work performed in the preceding 12 month period, when applicable. Backlog for newly initiated master service agreements and other long and short-term contracts is estimated using the anticipated scope of the contract and information received from the customer in the procurement process. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract. Revenue estimates reflected in our backlog can be subject to change due to a number of factors, including contract cancellations and contract changes made by our customers to the amount or nature of the work actually performed under a contract. In addition, revenue reflected in our backlog may be realized in periods different from those previously anticipated due to the factors above as well as project accelerations, or delays due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, customer scheduling changes, project modifications, commercial issues such as permitting, engineering revisions, difficult job site conditions, and adverse weather. The amount or timing of our backlog can also be impacted by the merger or acquisition activity of our customers. Our estimates of our customers’ requirements during a future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of the amount of or timing of future revenues and earnings.Our failure to comply with occupational health and workplace safety requirements could result in significant liabilities or enforcement actions and adversely impact our ability to perform services for our customers. Our operations are subject to strict 10Table of Contentslaws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery, work within the vicinity of high voltage lines, and engage in other potentially dangerous activities which could subject them and others to injury or death. If, in the course of our operations, it is determined we have violated safety regulations, our operations may be disrupted and we may be subject to penalties, fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, if our safety performance were to deteriorate, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to comply with immigration laws could result in significant liabilities and harm our reputation with our customers, as well as cause disruption to our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws our operations may be disrupted, and we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, many of our customer contracts specifically require compliance with immigration laws and in some cases our customers audit compliance with these laws. Further, several of our customers require that we ensure our subcontractors comply with these laws with respect to the workers that perform services for them. A failure to comply with these laws could damage our reputation and may result in the cancellation of our contracts by our customers, or a decision by our customers not to award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to comply with various laws and regulations related to contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles could result in significant liabilities. We are subject to a number of state and federal laws and regulations, including those related to contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations, we may be unable to perform services for our customers and may also be subject to fines, penalties, and the suspension or revocation of our licenses. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may affect our ability to operate and could require us to incur significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations.Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers and we often operate in close proximity to pipelines or underground storage tanks that may contain hazardous substances. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event that we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations or if we cause or are responsible for the release of hazardous substances or other environmental damages. These liabilities could result in significant costs including remediation costs, fines, third-party claims for property damage, loss of use, or personal injury, and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. These costs as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new remediation requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Our operations involve activities that are often inherently dangerous and are performed at times in complex or sensitive environments. If our activities result, or if it is alleged that our activities have resulted in, in damage or destruction to the real or personal property of others, or in injury or death to others, we could be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. Our operations involve dangerous activities such as underground drilling and the use of mechanized equipment in complex situations. These activities and their effects could result in, or be alleged to have resulted in, damage to the real and personal property of others, and cause personal injury or death to third parties or our employees. In many instances our activities are performed in close proximity to other utilities which, if damaged, may result in the occurrence of catastrophic events.  Additionally, we may perform our activities in environmentally sensitive locations or in locations that may be susceptible to catastrophic events, including wildfires. If our activities cause or contribute to, or are alleged to have caused or contributed to, a catastrophic event, we could be exposed to severe financial losses and reputational harm. We procure insurance coverage to cover many of these risks; however, there can be no assurance that these coverages will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that they are adequate in scope or amount to address financial losses from these risks. As a result, we could incur significant costs to defend any such allegations, defend and indemnify our customers, repair and replace assets, or to compensate third parties; reputational harm could result in the loss of future revenue generating opportunities; or we may be subject to civil and, in certain situations, criminal liabilities.Changes in the cost or availability of materials may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. For a majority of the contract services we perform, we are provided the materials necessary by our customers. Under other contracts, we supply part, or all, of the necessary materials. If we, or our customers, are unable to procure the materials necessary to the contract services we perform, or those materials are only available at undesirable prices, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. 11Table of ContentsA failure, outage, or cybersecurity breach of our technology systems or those of third-party providers may adversely affect our operations and financial results. We are increasingly dependent on technology to operate our business, to engage with our customers and other third parties, and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the services we offer our customers. We use both our own information technology systems and the information technology systems and expertise of third-party service providers to manage our operations, financial reporting, and other business processes. We also use information technology systems to record, transmit, store, and protect sensitive Company, employee, and customer information. A cyber-security attack on these information technology systems may result in financial loss, including potential fines and damages for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, many of our customer contracts can be terminated if we fail to adequately protect their data. The third-party systems of our business partners on which we rely could also fail or be subject to a cybersecurity attack. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business or the delivery of services to our customers, result in potential liabilities, the termination of contracts, divert the attention of management from effectively operating our business, cause significant reputational damage, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results. We may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against cybersecurity threats or to address actual breaches or to redress problems caused by cybersecurity breaches.We have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and attacks attempting to breach our systems and other similar incidents. In November 2017, we determined that certain of our computer systems were subject to unauthorized access. Our investigation determined that documents containing Company financial information were accessed. Law enforcement authorities were notified and new security enhancements and protocols were implemented. Although these prior cybersecurity incidents have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity, there is no assurance that future threats would not cause harm to our business and our reputation, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.The loss or long-term incapacitation of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We depend on the continued and ongoing services of our executive officers and other key employees, including the senior management of our subsidiaries. In many instances, these employees have many years of experience in our industry. Competition for senior management personnel is intense and we cannot be certain that any of our executive officers or other key management personnel will remain employed by us or that they will otherwise be able to provide service to us for any length of time. We do not carry “key-person” life or disability insurance on any of our employees. The loss or long-term incapacitation of any one of our executive officers or other key employees could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business.Our profitability is based on delivering services within the estimated costs established when we price our contracts. Substantially all of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks. Due to the fixed price nature of the tasks, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each task exceeds our original estimates, as pricing under these contracts is determined based on estimated costs established when we enter into the contracts. A variety of factors could negatively impact the actual cost, such as changes made by our customers to the scope and extent of the services that we are to provide under a contract, delays resulting from weather, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the contract, higher than expected costs of materials and labor, delays in obtaining necessary permits, under absorbed costs, and lower than anticipated productivity. An increase in costs due to any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations.Our business is labor-intensive, and we may be unable to attract, retain and ensure the productivity of qualified employees or to pass increased labor and training costs to our customers. We are highly dependent upon our ability to employ, train, retain, and ensure the productivity of skilled personnel to operate our business. Given the highly specialized work we perform, many of our employees receive training in, and possess, specialized technical skills that are necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain and ensure the productivity of the skilled labor force necessary to operate our business. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as the general rate of employment, competition for employees possessing the skills we need, the general health and welfare of our employees, and the level of compensation required to hire, train and retain qualified employees. In addition, the uncertainty of contract awards and project delays can also present difficulties in appropriately sizing our skilled labor force. Furthermore, due to the fixed price nature of the tasks in our long-term contracts, we may be unable to pass increases in labor and training costs on to our customers. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified employees or incur additional labor and training costs our results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be unable to secure independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us, either of which may adversely affect our relationships with our customers or cause us to incur additional costs. We contract with independent subcontractors to manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amounts that we would otherwise expend on fixed assets and working capital. If we are unable to secure independent 12Table of Contentssubcontractors with adequate labor resources at a reasonable cost, or at all, we may be delayed or unable to complete our work under a contract on a timely basis, or at all, and the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by independent subcontractors. Any of these factors could negatively impact the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain customer contracts, and our relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Changes in fuel prices may increase our costs, and we may not be able to pass along increased fuel costs to our customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on events outside of our control. Most of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks and do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term. In addition, we may be unable to secure prices that reflect rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions in conjunction with our anticipated fuel purchases, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the hedges we have in place may require us to make payments to our hedge counterparties. As a result, changes in fuel prices may adversely affect our results of operations.Increases in healthcare costs could adversely affect our financial results. The costs of providing employee medical benefits have steadily increased over a number of years due to, among other things, rising healthcare costs and legislative requirements. Because of the complex nature of healthcare laws, as well as periodic healthcare reform legislation adopted by Congress, state legislatures, and municipalities, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on our healthcare costs. Continued increases in healthcare costs or additional costs created by future health care reform laws adopted by Congress, state legislatures, or municipalities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and contract assets, which could become uncollectible. We extend credit to our customers because we perform work under contracts prior to being able to bill for that work. Deteriorating conditions in the industries we serve, bankruptcies, or financial difficulties of a customer or within the telecommunications sector generally may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. In addition, although in some instances we may have the right to file liens for certain projects we may not be successful in enforcing those liens. The failure or delay in payment by one or more of our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. On February 25, 2019, Windstream filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. As of January 26, 2019, the Company had outstanding receivables and contract assets in aggregate of approximately $45.0 million. Against this amount, we recorded a non-cash charge of $17.2 million reflecting our evaluation of recoverability of these receivables and contract assets as of January 26, 2019. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we recovered $10.3 million of these previously reserved accounts receivable and contract assets. Fluctuations in our effective tax rate and tax liabilities may cause volatility in our financial results. We determine and provide for income taxes based on the tax laws of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the mix and level of earnings among jurisdictions could materially impact our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period. Our effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local level, or new interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) was enacted, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $32.2 million during fiscal 2018, primarily due to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at a lower tax rate. Our interpretations of the provisions of Tax Reform could differ from future interpretations and guidance from the U.S Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other regulatory agencies, including state taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also subject to audits by various taxing authorities. An adverse outcome from an audit could unfavorably impact our effective tax rate and increase our tax liabilities. Changes to accounting rules can also cause fluctuation in our effective tax rate. For example, under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which we adopted during fiscal 2019, certain tax effects of the vesting and exercise of share-based awards are recognized in our provision for income taxes rather than in additional paid-in capital. These tax effects vary from period to period and can cause increased volatility in our effective tax rate. Any of the factors described above could cause volatility in our results of operations or otherwise impact our financial position or cash flows.The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the 13Table of Contentsamounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data and, accordingly, requires the use of management’s judgment. Estimates and assumptions are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue under the cost-to-cost method of progress, job specific costs, accrued insurance claims, the allowance for doubtful accounts, accruals for contingencies, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, the fair value of reporting units for the goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, and income taxes. When made, we believe that such estimates and assumptions are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, and such differences may be material to our financial statements.We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance-related liabilities. Within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), environmental liability, workers’ compensation, and employee group health. We are effectively self-insured for the majority of claims because most claims against us fall below the deductibles under our insurance policies. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances, and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors not known at the time such estimates are made. These factors include the estimated development of claims, the payment pattern of claims incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions, and court interpretations. Should the cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 11, Accrued Insurance Claims, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may be subject to litigation, indemnity claims, and other disputes, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. From time to time, we are subject to lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, and other claims brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, liquidated damages, consequential damages, punitive damages and civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we may also be subject to class action lawsuits, including those alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, state and municipal wage and hour laws, and misclassification of independent contractors. We also indemnify our customers for claims arising out of or related to the services we provide and our actions or omissions under our contracts. In some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for the actions or omissions of our customers, subcontractors, or other third parties.Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution proceedings, we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Class action lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts. Accordingly, the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of any litigation or proceeding through settlement, mediation, or a judgment could have a material impact on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Note 21, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may be subject to warranty claims, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. We typically warrant the services we provide by guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and materials. When warranty claims occur, we may be required to repair or replace warrantied items without receiving any additional compensation. Our performance of warranty services requires us to allocate resources that otherwise might be engaged in the provision of services that generate revenue. In addition, our customers often have the right to repair or replace warrantied items using the services of another provider and to charge the cost of the repair or replacement to us. Costs incurred for warranty claims, or reductions to revenue-generating activities arising from the allocation of resources to resolve warranty claims, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Several of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans under which we could incur significant liabilities. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, several of our subsidiaries participate in various multiemployer pension plans that provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to participants. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not 14Table of Contentssegregated into a separate account and are not restricted to providing benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), absent an applicable exemption, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon withdrawal from the plan for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liability. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate become significantly underfunded, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions in the form of higher contribution rates or surcharges. This could occur because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on plan assets, or other funding deficiencies. Requirements to pay increased contributions or a withdrawal liability could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, one of the Company’s subsidiaries, which previously contributed to the the Pension, Hospitalization and Benefit Plan of the Electrical Industry - Pension Trust Fund (the “Withdrawal Dispute Plan”), ceased operations. In October 2016, the Withdrawal Dispute Plan demanded payment for a claimed withdrawal liability of approximately $13.0 million. In December 2016, we submitted a formal request seeking review of the withdrawal liability determination. We dispute the claim that we are required to make payment of a withdrawal liability as we believe there is a statutory exemption under ERISA that applies to our activities. The Withdrawal Dispute Plan has taken the position that the work at issue does not qualify for the statutory exemption. We have submitted this dispute to arbitration, as required by ERISA, with a hearing expected during calendar year 2020. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in asserting the statutory exemption as a defense in the arbitration proceeding. As required by ERISA, in November 2016, the subsidiary began making monthly withdrawal liability payments to the Withdrawal Dispute Plan in the amount of approximately $0.1 million. If we prevail in disputing the withdrawal liability, all such payments will be refunded.We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, reporting units are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate their fair value may be below their carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of an annual or interim test, an impairment loss is recognized.Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand, increased costs of providing our services, and the level of overall economic activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects due to changes in technology, a slowing or uncertain economy, merger or acquisition activity, a decision to allocate resources to other areas of their business, or other reasons. The profitability of reporting units may also suffer if actual costs of providing our services exceed our estimated costs established when we enter into contracts. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a small number of customers may also cause results to vary. The factors identified above may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. A write-down of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment could adversely affect our results of operations.We may not have access in the future to sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to pursue acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, and for working capital needs, or to respond to changing business conditions. Our existing credit agreement contains significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt. In addition, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to access additional capital could adversely affect our liquidity and may limit our growth and ability to execute our business strategy.Our debt obligations impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility, and a failure to comply with these obligations could result in the acceleration of our debt. We have a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $750.0 million revolving facility, $450.0 million in aggregate term loan facilities, and contains a sublimit of $200.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. As of January 25, 2020, we had $444.4 million outstanding under the term loans and $52.3 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under our credit agreement. We did not have any outstanding borrowings under our revolving facility as of January 25, 2020. This credit agreement contains covenants that restrict or limit our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends, redeem or repurchase our 15Table of Contentscapital stock, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make investments or create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell certain assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. Our credit agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. In addition, our credit agreement contains a minimum liquidity covenant. This covenant becomes effective beginning 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Company’s $460.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due September 2021 (the “Notes”) if the outstanding principal amount of the Notes is greater than $250.0 million. In such event, we would be required to maintain liquidity, as defined by our credit agreement, equal to $150.0 million in excess of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes. These restrictions may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us and may limit our flexibility in the execution of our business strategy. Additionally, the indenture governing the Notes includes cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions with our bank credit facility. If our financial results fall below anticipated levels, we may be unable to comply with these covenants and a default under our credit agreement could result in the acceleration of our obligations under both our credit agreement and the indenture governing the Notes, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to execute our business strategy.Conversion of the Notes or exercise of the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. At our election, we may settle the Notes tendered for conversion entirely or partly in shares of our common stock. Further, the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions may be settled on a net-share basis. As a result, the conversion of some or all of the Notes or the exercise of some or all of such warrants may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion of the Notes or such exercise of the warrants could adversely affect the then-prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.Our convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions may affect our common stock. In connection with the issuance of our Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties. These hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlay the Notes sold in the offering. We also entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions from time to time. They may do so by purchasing and/or selling shares of our common stock and/or other securities of ours, including the Notes, in privately negotiated transactions and/or open-market transactions or by entering into and/or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The hedge counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes or following any repurchase of the Notes by us on any fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) repurchase date. The effect, if any, of these transactions on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and lead to increased volatility in transactions involving our common stock. In addition, there may be no visibility with respect to transactions involving the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates, and those parties may choose to engage in, or to discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be at their sole discretion and not within our control.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. We are subject to the risk that the financial institutions that are counterparties to the convertible note hedge transactions could default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties is unsecured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in failure or financial difficulties for many financial institutions. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any hedge counterparty.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2020, our common stock fluctuated from a low of $40.47 per share to a high of $63.67 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;•announcements by our customers regarding their capital spending and start-up, deferral or cancellation of projects, ortheir mergers and acquisitions activities;16Table of Contents•the commercialization of new technologies impacting the services that we provide to our customers; •government regulatory actions and changes in tax laws;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and •the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.In addition, other factors, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, widespread public health epidemics, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Our failure to perform sufficient due diligence prior to completing acquisitions could result in significant liabilities. The growth of our business through acquisitions may expose us to risks, including the failure to identify significant issues and risks of an acquired business. A failure to identify or appropriately quantify a liability in our due diligence process could result in the assumption of unanticipated liabilities arising from the prior operations of an acquired business, some of which may not be adequately reserved and may not be covered by indemnification obligations. The assumption of unknown liabilities due to a failure of our due diligence could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our financial results. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. The success of this strategy depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing operations and elimination of redundant costs. To realize these benefits, we must successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations. Integrating acquired businesses involves a number of operational challenges and risks, including diversion of management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications, and other systems and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company; and failure to retain management and other key employees. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our Company or a change in our control. We are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control. In addition, certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to elect approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders. As a result, our shareholders may be unable to take advantage of opportunities to dispose of their stock in the Company at higher prices that may otherwise be available in connection with takeover attempts or under a merger or other proposal"
3,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2019-03-04,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.Economic downturns, uncertain economic conditions, and capital market fluctuations may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. During an economic downturn, or when uncertainty regarding current or future economic conditions is elevated, our customers may reduce or eliminate their spending on the services we provide. In addition, volatility in the debt or equity markets may impact our customers’ access to capital and result in the reduction or elimination of spending on the services we provide. These conditions, which can develop rapidly, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.Regulatory changes may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Our customers operate in regulated industries and are subject to regulations that can change frequently and without notice. The adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes to the enforcement or interpretation of existing laws or regulations, could cause our customers to reduce spending on the services we provide, which could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity.  Technological change may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. We generate a significant majority of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. This industry has been and continues to be impacted by rapid technological change. These changes may affect our customers’ spending on the services we provide. Further, technological change in the telecommunications industry not directly related to the services we provide may affect the ability of one or more of our customers to compete effectively, which could result in a reduction or elimination of their use of our services. Any reduction or elimination of spending by one of our customers on the services we provide could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers in fiscal 2019, the 2018 transition period, fiscal 2017, and fiscal 2016 accounting for approximately 78.4%, 75.8%, 76.8%, and 70.1% of our total revenues, respectively. Our industry is highly competitive and the revenue we expect from an existing customer in any market could fail to be realized if competitors who offer comparable services to our customers do so on more favorable terms or have a better relationship with a customer. Additionally, the continued consolidation of the telecommunications industry could result in the loss of a customer if, as a result of a merger or acquisition involving one or more of our customers, the surviving entity chooses to use one of our competitors for the services we currently provide. On February 25, 2019, Windstream, our fifth largest customer with contract revenues of $113.6 million during fiscal 2019, filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. We expect to continue to provide services to Windstream pursuant to existing contractual obligations but the amount of services performed in the future could be reduced or eliminated. The loss of a significant customer, or reduction in services performed for a significant customer, could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. 9Table of ContentsThe capital and operating expenditure budgets and seasonal spending patterns of our customers affect demand for our services. Generally, our customers have no obligation to assign specific amounts of work to us. Customers decide to engage us to provide services based on, among other things, the amount of capital they have available and their spending priorities. Our customers’ capital budgets may change for reasons over which we have no control. These changes may occur quickly and without advance notice. Any fluctuation in the capital or operating expenditure budgets and priorities of our customers could adversely affect our revenues, results of operations, and liquidity. Seasonality affects demand for our services. Our revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, adverse weather, which is more likely to occur with greater frequency, severity, and duration during the winter, as well as reduced daylight hours, impact our operations disproportionately during the fiscal quarters ending in January and April. The effect of weather delays on our projects may be significant if we are unable to adjust the project schedule for such delays. In addition, a disproportionate number of holidays fall within the fiscal quarter ending in January, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience reduced revenue and profitability during our fiscal quarters ending in January and April compared to our fiscal quarters ending in July and October. The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous local and regional providers, as well as several large multinational corporations that may have financial, technical, and marketing resources exceeding ours. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. Any organization may become a competitor if it has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise, the ability to engage subcontractors, and the necessary equipment and materials. Additionally, our competitors may develop expertise, experience, and resources to provide services that are equal or superior to our services in price, quality, or availability, and we may be unable to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of our contracts upon the expiration of their terms. If competitors underbid us to procure business, we could be required to lower the prices we charge in order to retain contracts. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our customers shift a significant portion of our work to a competitor, if we are unsuccessful in bidding or retaining projects, or if our ability to win projects requires us to provide our services at reduced margins.We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers. We face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform a portion of the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected if our existing or prospective customers reduce the specialty contracting services that are outsourced to us. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from multi-year master service agreements and other long-term contracts which our customers may cancel at any time or may reschedule previously assigned work. The majority of our long-term contracts are cancellable by our customers with little or no advance notice and for any, or no, reason. Our customers may also have the right to cancel or remove assigned work without canceling the contract or to reschedule previously assigned work. In addition, these contracts typically include a fixed term that is subject to renewal on a periodic basis. We may be unsuccessful in renewing contracts when their fixed terms expire. Our projected revenues assume that definitive work orders have been, or will be issued by our customer, and that the work will be completed. The potential loss of work under master service agreements and other long-term contracts, or the rescheduling of previously assigned work by a customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity, as well as any projections we provide.Our contracts contain provisions that may require us to pay damages or incur costs if we fail to meet our contractual obligations. If we do not meet our contractual obligations our customers may look to us to pay damages or pursue other remedies, including, in some instances, the payment of liquidated damages. Additionally, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, or if our customer anticipates that we cannot meet our contractual obligations, our customers may, in certain circumstances, seek reimbursement from us to cover the incremental cost of having a third party complete or remediate our work. Our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to pay damages or incur costs as a result of a failure to meet our contractual obligations. Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation, and revenues may be realized in different periods than initially reflected in our backlog. Our backlog includes the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under master services agreements and other contractual agreements with our customers. These estimates are based on contract terms and evaluations regarding the timing of the services to be provided. In the case of master service agreements, backlog is calculated using the amount of work performed in the preceding twelve month period, when applicable. Backlog for newly initiated 10Table of Contentsmaster service agreements and other long and short-term contracts is estimated using the anticipated scope of the contract and information received from the customer in the procurement process. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract. Revenue estimates reflected in our backlog can be subject to change due to a number of factors, including contract cancellations and contract changes made by our customers to the amount or nature of the work actually performed under a contract. In addition, revenue reflected in our backlog may be realized in periods different from those previously reported due to the factors above as well as project accelerations, or delays due to various reasons, including, but not limited to, customer scheduling changes, commercial issues such as permitting, engineering revisions, difficult job site conditions, and adverse weather. The amount or timing of our backlog can also be impacted by the merger or acquisition activity of our customers. Our estimates of our customers’ requirements during a future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of the amount of or timing of future revenues and earnings.Our failure to comply with occupational health and workplace safety requirements could result in significant liabilities or enforcement actions and adversely impact our ability to perform services for our customers. Our operations are subject to strict laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery, work within the vicinity of high voltage lines, and engage in other potentially dangerous activities which could subject them and others to injury or death. If, in the course of our operations, it is determined we have violated safety regulations, our operations may be disrupted and we may be subject to penalties, fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, if our safety performance were to deteriorate, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Our failure to comply with immigration laws could result in significant liabilities and harm our reputation with our customers, as well as cause disruption to our operations. If we fail to comply with these laws our operations may be disrupted, and we may be subject to fines or, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. In addition, many of our customer contracts specifically require compliance with immigration laws and in some cases our customers audit compliance with these laws. Further, several of our customers require that we ensure our subcontractors comply with these laws with respect to the workers that perform services for them. A failure to comply with these laws could damage our reputation and may result in the cancellation of our contracts by our customers, or a decision by our customers not to award us future business. These factors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to comply with various laws and regulations related to contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles could result in significant liabilities. We are subject to a number of state and federal laws and regulations, including those related to contractor licensing and the operation of our fleet of commercial motor vehicles. If we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations, we may be unable to perform services for our customers and may also be subject to fines, penalties, and the suspension or revocation of our licenses. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations may affect our ability to operate and could require us to incur significant costs that adversely affect our results of operations.Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers and we often operate in close proximity to pipelines or underground storage tanks that may contain hazardous substances. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event that we fail to comply with environmental laws or regulations or we cause or are responsible for the release of hazardous substances or other environmental damages. These liabilities could result in significant costs including remediation costs, fines, third-party claims for property damage, loss of use, or personal injury, and, in extreme cases, criminal sanctions. These costs as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new remediation requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Our operations involve activities that are often inherently dangerous and are performed at times in complex or sensitive environments. If our activities result in damage or destruction to the real or personal property of others, or in injury or death to others, we could be exposed to significant financial losses and reputational harm, as well as civil and criminal liabilities. Our operations involve dangerous activities such as underground drilling and the use of mechanized equipment in complex situations. In many instances, those activities are performed in close proximity to other utilities, in environmentally sensitive locations, or in locations that may be susceptible to significant damage. These activities could result in damage to the real and personal property of others, and cause personal injury or death to third parties or our employees. We procure insurance coverage to cover many of these risks; however, there can be no assurance that this coverage will be adequate in scope or amount to address the potential financial losses arising from our operations. As a result, we could incur significant costs to 11Table of Contentsrepair and replace assets or to compensate third parties; reputational harm could result in the loss of future revenue generating opportunities; or we may be subject to civil and, in certain situations, criminal liabilities.Changes in the cost or availability of materials may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. For a majority of the contract services we perform, we are provided the materials necessary by our customers. Under other contracts, we supply part, or all, of the necessary materials. If we, or our customers, are unable to procure the materials necessary to the contract services we perform, or those materials are only available at undesirable prices, our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected. A failure, outage, or cybersecurity breach of our technology systems or those of third-party providers may adversely affect our operations and financial results. We are increasingly dependent on technology to operate our business, to engage with our customers and other third parties, and to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the services we offer our customers. We use both our own information technology systems and the information technology systems and expertise of third-party service providers to manage our operations, financial reporting, and other business processes. We also use information technology systems to record, transmit, store, and protect sensitive Company, employee, and customer information. A cyber-security attack on these information technology systems may result in financial loss, including potential fines and damages for failure to safeguard data, and may negatively impact our reputation. Additionally, many of our customer contracts can be terminated if we fail to adequately protect their data. The third-party systems of our business partners on which we rely could also fail or be subject to a cybersecurity attack. Any of these occurrences could disrupt our business or the delivery of services to our customers, result in potential liabilities, the termination of contracts, divert the attention of management from effectively operating our business, cause significant reputational damage, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our financial results. We may also need to expend significant additional resources to protect against cybersecurity threats or to address actual breaches or to redress problems caused by cybersecurity breaches.We have experienced cybersecurity threats to our information technology infrastructure and attacks attempting to breach our systems and other similar incidents. In November 2017, we determined that certain of our computer systems were subject to unauthorized access. Our investigation determined that documents containing Company financial information were accessed. Law enforcement authorities were notified and new security enhancements and protocols were implemented. Although these prior cybersecurity incidents have not had a material impact on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity, there is no assurance that future threats would not cause harm to our business and our reputation, and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.The loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We depend on the services of our executive officers and other key employees, including the senior management of our subsidiaries. These employees have many years of experience in our industry. Competition for senior management personnel is intense and we cannot be certain that any of our executive officers or other key management personnel will remain employed by us in such capacity for any length of time. We do not carry “key-person” life insurance on any of our employees. The loss of any one of our executive officers or other key employees could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy, which could adversely affect our business.Our profitability is based on delivering services within the estimated costs established when we price our contracts. Substantially all of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks. Due to the fixed price nature of the tasks, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each task exceeds our original estimates, as pricing under these contracts is determined based on estimated costs established when we enter into the contracts. A variety of factors could negatively impact the actual cost, such as changes made by our customers to the scope and extent of the services that we are to provide under a contract, delays resulting from weather, conditions at work sites differing materially from those anticipated at the time we bid on the contract, higher than expected costs of materials and labor, delays in obtaining necessary permits, under absorbed costs, and lower than anticipated productivity. An increase in costs due to any of these factors could adversely affect our results of operations.Our business is labor-intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees or to pass increased labor and training costs to our customers. Our ability to employ, train, and retain skilled personnel is necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. Given the highly specialized work we perform, many of our employees receive training in, and possess, specialized technical skills that are necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as the general rate of employment, competition for employees possessing the skills we need, and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees. In addition, the uncertainty of contract awards and project delays can also present difficulties in appropriately sizing our skilled labor force. Furthermore, due to the fixed price nature of the tasks in our long-term contracts, we may be 12Table of Contentsunable to pass increases in labor and training costs on to our customers. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified employees or incur additional labor and training costs our results of operations could be adversely affected. We may be unable to secure independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us, either of which may adversely affect our relationships with our customers or cause us to incur additional costs. We contract with independent subcontractors to manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amounts that we would otherwise expend on fixed assets and working capital. If we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all, we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by independent subcontractors. Any of these factors could negatively impact the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain customer contracts, and our relationships with our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Changes in fuel prices may increase our costs, and we may not be able to pass along increased fuel costs to our customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on events outside of our control. Most of our services are provided under contracts that have discrete pricing for individual tasks and do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term. In addition, we may be unable to secure prices that reflect rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions in conjunction with our anticipated fuel purchases, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the hedges we have in place may require us to make payments to our hedge counterparties. As a result, changes in fuel prices may adversely affect our results of operations.Increases in healthcare costs could adversely affect our financial results. The costs of providing employee medical benefits have steadily increased over a number of years due to, among other things, rising healthcare costs and legislative requirements. Because of the complex nature of healthcare laws, as well as periodic healthcare reform legislation adopted by Congress, state legislatures, and municipalities, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on our healthcare costs. Continued increases in healthcare costs or additional costs created by future health care reform laws adopted by Congress, state legislatures, or municipalities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and contract assets, which could become uncollectible. We extend credit to our customers because we perform work under contracts prior to being able to bill for that work. Deteriorating conditions in the industries we serve, bankruptcies, or financial difficulties of a customer or within the telecommunications sector generally may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. In addition, although we may under state laws file liens for certain projects we may not be successful in enforcing those liens. The failure or delay in payment by one or more of our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. On February 25, 2019, Windstream filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. As of January 26, 2019, the Company had outstanding receivables and contract assets in aggregate of approximately $45.0 million. Against this amount, we have recorded a non-cash charge of $17.2 million reflecting our current evaluation of recoverability of these receivables and contract assets as of January 26, 2019. The actual amount received for our outstanding accounts receivable and contract assets may differ from the estimated recoverable value and such difference may be material to our financial statements.Fluctuations in our effective tax rate and tax liabilities may cause volatility in our financial results. We determine and provide for income taxes based on the tax laws of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Changes in the mix and level of earnings among jurisdictions could materially impact our effective tax rate in any given financial statement period. Our effective tax rate may also be affected by changes in tax laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local level, or new interpretations of existing tax laws and regulations. In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform”) was enacted, reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $32.2 million during the 2018 transition period, primarily due to the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities at a lower tax rate. Our interpretations of the provisions of Tax Reform could differ from future interpretations and guidance from the U.S Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service, and other regulatory agencies, including state taxing authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. We are also subject to audits by various taxing authorities. An adverse outcome from an audit could unfavorably impact our effective tax rate and increase our tax liabilities. Changes to accounting rules can also cause fluctuation in our effective tax rate. For example, under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which we adopted during the 2018 transition period, certain tax effects of the vesting and exercise of share-based awards are recognized in our provision for income taxes rather than in 13Table of Contentsadditional paid-in capital. These tax effects vary from period to period and can cause increased volatility in our effective tax rate. Any of the factors described above could cause volatility in our results of operations or otherwise impact our financial position or cash flows.The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data and, accordingly, requires the use of management’s judgment. Estimates and assumptions are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue under the cost-to-cost method of progress, job specific costs, accrued insurance claims, the allowance for doubtful accounts, accruals for contingencies, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, the fair value of reporting units for the goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, and income taxes. When made, we believe that such estimates and assumptions are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions, and such differences may be material to our financial statements.We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance-related liabilities. Within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), environmental liability, workers’ compensation, and employee group health. We are effectively self-insured for the majority of claims because most claims against us fall below the deductibles under our insurance policies. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances, and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors not known at the time such estimates are made. These factors include the estimated development of claims, the payment pattern of claims incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions, and court interpretations. Should the cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur additional charges that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 11, Accrued Insurance Claims, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may be subject to litigation, indemnity claims, and other disputes, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. From time to time, we are subject to lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, and other claims brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination and other employment-related damages, breach of contract, property damage, multiemployer pension plan withdrawal liabilities, liquidated damages, consequential damages, punitive damages and civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. In addition, we may also be subject to class action lawsuits, including those alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, state and municipal wage and hour laws, and misclassification of independent contractors. We also indemnify our customers for claims arising out of or related to the services we provide and our actions or omissions under our contracts. In some instances, we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for the actions or omissions of our customers, subcontractors, or other third parties.Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and other dispute resolution proceedings, we cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Class action lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts. Accordingly, the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of any litigation or proceeding through settlement, mediation, or a judgment could have a material impact on our reputation and adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, and Note 20, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may be subject to warranty claims, which could result in significant liabilities and adversely impact our financial results. We typically warrant the services we provide by guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and materials. When warranty claims occur, we may be required to repair or replace warrantied items without receiving any additional compensation. Our performance of warranty services requires us to allocate resources that otherwise might be 14Table of Contentsengaged in the provision of services that generate revenue. In addition, our customers often have the right to repair or replace warrantied items using the services of another provider and to charge the cost of the repair or replacement to us. Costs incurred for warranty claims, or reductions to revenue-generating activities arising from the allocation of resources to resolve warranty claims, could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Several of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans under which we could incur significant liabilities. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, several of our subsidiaries participate in various multiemployer pension plans that provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. We make periodic contributions to these plans to allow them to meet their pension benefit obligations to participants. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to providing benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), absent an applicable exemption, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon withdrawal from the plan for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liability. Such underfunding may increase in the event other employers become insolvent or withdraw from the applicable plan or upon the inability or failure of withdrawing employers to pay their withdrawal liability. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate become significantly underfunded, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions in the form of higher contribution rates or surcharges. This could occur because of a shrinking contribution base as a result of insolvency or withdrawal of other companies that currently contribute to these plans, inability or failure of withdrawing companies to pay their withdrawal liability, lower than expected returns on plan assets, or other funding deficiencies. Requirements to pay increased contributions or a withdrawal liability could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, one of our subsidiaries ceased operations. This subsidiary contributed to a multiemployer pension plan, the Pension, Hospitalization and Benefit Plan of the Electrical Industry - Pension Trust Fund (the “Plan”). In October 2016, the Plan demanded payment for a claimed withdrawal liability of approximately $13.0 million. In December 2016, we submitted a formal request to the Plan seeking review of the Plan’s withdrawal liability determination. We are disputing the claim of a withdrawal liability demanded by the Plan as we believe there is a statutory exemption available under ERISA for multiemployer pension plans that primarily cover employees in the building and construction industry. The Plan has taken the position that the work at issue does not qualify for the statutory exemption. We have submitted this dispute to arbitration, as required by ERISA, with a hearing expected during the first half of calendar 2019. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in asserting the statutory exemption as a defense in the arbitration proceeding. As required by ERISA, in November 2016, the subsidiary began making monthly payments of a withdrawal liability to the Plan in the amount of approximately $0.1 million. If we prevail in disputing the withdrawal liability, all such payments will be refunded to the subsidiary. If we do not prevail, we will continue to make such payments until the claimed withdrawal liability has been paid.We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC Topic 350”). We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, reporting units are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that indicate their fair value may be below their carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of an annual or interim test, an impairment loss is recognized.Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand, increased costs of providing our services, and the level of overall economic activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects due to changes in technology, a slowing or uncertain economy, merger or acquisition activity, a decision to allocate resources to other areas of their business, or other reasons. The profitability of reporting units may also suffer if actual costs of providing our services exceed our estimated costs established when we enter into contracts. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a small number of customers may also cause results to vary. The factors identified above may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. A write-down of goodwill or intangible assets as a result of an impairment could adversely affect our results of operations.We may not have access in the future to sufficient capital on favorable terms or at all. We may require additional capital to pursue acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, and for working capital needs, or to respond to changing business conditions. 15Table of ContentsOur existing credit agreement contains significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt. In addition, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Our inability to access additional capital could adversely affect our liquidity and may limit our growth and ability to execute our business strategy.Our debt obligations impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility, and a failure to comply with these obligations could result in the acceleration of our debt. We have a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $750.0 million revolving facility, $450.0 million in aggregate term loan facilities, and contains a sublimit of $200.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. As of January 26, 2019, we had $450.0 million outstanding under the term loans and $48.6 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement. We did not have any outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility as of January 26, 2019. This credit agreement contains covenants that restrict or limit our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make investments or create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell certain assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. The credit agreement also requires us to comply with certain financial covenants, including a consolidated net leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. In addition, the credit agreement contains a minimum liquidity covenant. This covenant becomes effective beginning 91 days prior to the maturity date of the Company’s $485.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due September 2021 (the “Notes”) if the outstanding principal amount of the Notes is greater than $250.0 million. In such event, we would be required to maintain liquidity, as defined by the credit agreement, equal to $150.0 million in excess of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes. These restrictions may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us and may limit our flexibility in the execution of our business strategy. Additionally, the indenture governing the Notes includes cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions with our bank credit facility. If our financial results fall below anticipated levels, we may be unable to comply with these covenants and a default under our credit agreement could result in the acceleration of our obligations under both the credit agreement and the indenture governing the Notes, which could adversely affect our liquidity.Conversion of the Notes or exercise of the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions may dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders. At our election, we may settle the Notes tendered for conversion entirely or partly in shares of our common stock. Further, the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions may be settled on a net-share basis. As a result, the conversion of some or all of the Notes or the exercise of some or all of such warrants may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion of the Notes or such exercise of the warrants could adversely affect the then-prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.Our convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions may affect our common stock. In connection with the issuance of our Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties. These hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlay the Notes sold in the offering. We also entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions from time to time. They may do so by purchasing and/or selling shares of our common stock and/or other securities of ours, including the Notes, in privately negotiated transactions and/or open-market transactions or by entering into and/or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The hedge counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes or following any repurchase of the Notes by us on any fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) repurchase date. The effect, if any, of these transactions on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and lead to increased volatility in transactions involving our common stock. In addition, there may be no visibility with respect to transactions involving the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates, and those parties may choose to engage in, or to discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be at their sole discretion and not within our control.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. We are subject to the risk that the financial institutions that are counterparties to the convertible note hedge transactions could default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties is unsecured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in failure or financial difficulties for many financial institutions. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently 16Table of Contentsanticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any hedge counterparty.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2019, our common stock fluctuated from a low of $49.39 per share to a high of $122.80 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;•announcements by our customers regarding their capital spending and start-up, deferral or cancellation of projects, ortheir mergers and acquisitions activities;•the commercialization of new technologies impacting the services that we provide to our customers; •government regulatory actions and changes in tax laws;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and •the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.In addition, other factors, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Our failure to perform sufficient due diligence prior to completing acquisitions could result in significant liabilities. The growth of our business through acquisitions may expose us to risks, including the failure to identify significant issues and risks of an acquired business. A failure to identify or appropriately quantify a liability in our due diligence process could result in the assumption of unanticipated liabilities arising from the prior operations of an acquired business, some of which may not be adequately reserved and may not be covered by indemnification obligations. The assumption of unknown liabilities due to a failure of our due diligence could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our financial results. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. The success of this strategy depends on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the acquired businesses, such as the expansion of our existing operations and elimination of redundant costs. To realize these benefits, we must successfully integrate the operations of the acquired businesses with our existing operations. Integrating acquired businesses involves a number of operational challenges and risks, including diversion of management’s attention from our existing business; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications, and other systems and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company; and failure to retain management and other key employees. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets as a result of our failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our Company or a change in our control. We are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control. In addition, certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to elect approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of shareholders to call a special meeting of shareholders. As a result, our shareholders may be unable to take advantage of opportunities to dispose of their stock in the Company at higher prices that may otherwise be available in connection with takeover attempts or under a merger or other proposal.17Table of Contents"
14,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2017-09-01,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns affecting the industries we serve. Demand for our services has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry. During times of uncertain or slowing economic conditions, our customers often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. In addition, uncertain or adverse economic conditions that create volatility in the credit and equity markets may reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers causing them to reduce capital spending. Any reduction in capital spending or deferral or cancellation of projects by our existing or prospective customers could reduce demand for, or the timing of, our services, adversely affecting our operations, cash flows, and liquidity. In addition, these conditions make it difficult to estimate our customers’ demand for our services and add uncertainty to the determination of our backlog. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements and other long-term contracts which may be canceled by our customers upon notice, do not guaranty a specific amount of work, or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms. During fiscal 2017, we derived approximately 87.0% of our revenues from master service agreements and other long-term contracts. The majority of these contracts are cancelable by our customers upon notice regardless of whether or not we are in default. In addition, our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements. Consequently, projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed with us and the work completed. This makes it difficult to estimate our customers’ demand for our services. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of these contracts upon expiration of their terms. We may not be able to renew a contract if our competitors reduce their prices and underbid us in order to procure business, or we could be required to lower the price charged for work under the contract being rebid in order to retain the contract. The loss of work obtained through master service agreements and other long-term contracts or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.The telecommunications industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid technological, structural, and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues. We generate the majority of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer demands. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce the need for our services by enabling telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. New, developing, or existing services could displace the wireline or wireless systems that we install and that our customers use to deliver services to consumers and businesses. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer due to technological changes could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers through competition from other service providers, industry consolidation or otherwise could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers in each of fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015 accounting for approximately 76.1%, 69.7%, and 61.1% of our total revenues, respectively. Revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period to period depending on the timing or volume of work that those customers order or perform with their in-house service organizations. Our revenue could significantly decline if we were to lose one or more of our significant customers or if one or more of our customers were to elect to do the work we provide with their 9Table of Contentsin-house service teams or shift a significant portion of that work to another service provider. Additionally, the telecommunications industry has been characterized by consolidation. In the case of a consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer, the amount of work we receive could be reduced if procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity change from those of the existing customer or the surviving entity chooses to use a different service provider. The loss of work from a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous small, privately owned companies, as well as several large corporations that may have financial, technical, and marketing resources exceeding ours. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. Any organization may become a competitor if they have adequate financial resources, access to technical expertise, and the necessary equipment and materials. Additionally, our competitors may develop expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior to our services in both price and quality, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in bidding on projects, if our ability to win projects requires that we settle for reduced margins or if our existing or prospective customers reduce the amount of specialty contracting services that are outsourced.Our profitability is based on our delivering services within the estimated costs established when pricing our contracts. We perform a majority of our services under master service agreements and other agreements that contain customer-specified service requirements, having discrete pricing for individual tasks. Revenue is recognized under these arrangements based on units-of-delivery as each unit is completed. Due to the fixed price nature of these contracts, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates. The remainder of our services, representing less than 5% of our contract revenues during each of fiscal 2017 and 2016 and less than 10% of our contract revenues during fiscal 2015, are performed under contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting. Revenue is recognized under these arrangements based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract. The cost estimation process is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals. Due to the fixed price nature of our contracts, any changes in original cost estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may result in changes to costs, thereby reducing our profitability. We recognize these changes in the period in which they are determined, potentially resulting in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, which could become uncollectible. We extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing for that work. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and regularly monitor the timeliness of their payments. However, slowing conditions in the industries we serve, bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. As of July 29, 2017, we had net accounts receivable of $369.8 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $389.3 million. The failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our expected cash flows and adversely affect our liquidity and profitability.We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance-related liabilities. Within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability (including damages associated with underground facility locating services), workers’ compensation, and employee group health. We are self-insured for the majority of all claims because most claims against us fall below the deductibles under our insurance policies. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors not known with precision. These factors include the estimated development of claims, the payment pattern of claims incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations. Should the cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 8, Accrued Insurance Claims, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation. Our backlog consists of the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contractual obligations with our customers. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract and may cancel a contract for convenience. Our backlog estimates represent amounts under master service agreements and other contractual agreements for services projected to be 10Table of Contentsperformed over the terms of the contracts and are based on contract terms, our historical experience with customers and, more generally, our experience in similar procurements. The significant majority of our backlog estimates comprise services under master service agreements and other long-term contracts. Revenue estimates included in our backlog have in the past and may in the future be subject to change because of project accelerations, contract cancellations, or delays due to various factors, including, but not limited to, commercial issues such as permitting, engineering changes, incremental documentation requirements, difficult job site conditions, and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue to be realized in different periods or in different amounts from those originally reflected in backlog. Our estimates of a customer’s requirements during a particular future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenues and earnings.We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC Topic 350”). Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, reporting units are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized. Any such write-down would adversely affect our results of operations.The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand and the level of overall economic activity, including in particular construction and housing activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects during times of slowing economic conditions. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers may also cause results to vary. These factors may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract or property damage. In addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits, including those involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. For a description of current legal proceedings, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries who have many years of experience in our industry. The loss of any one of them could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy, adversely affecting our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers and other key employees, we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time. We do not carry “key-person” life insurance on any of our employees.Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to employ, train, and retain skilled personnel is necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for employees possessing the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees. In addition, our 11Table of Contentslabor costs may increase when there is a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel and we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers due to the long-term nature of our contracts, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. We may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us. We contract with independent subcontractors to help manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amount that we would otherwise expend on fixed assets and working capital. If we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all, we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs in order to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by subcontractors. Any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain contracts and our relationship with our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. The nature of our business exposes us to warranty claims, which may reduce our profitability. We typically warrant the services we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and the material we supply. Historically, warranty claims have not been material as our customers evaluate much of the work we perform for defects shortly after work is completed. However, if warranty claims occur, we could be required to repair or replace warrantied items at our cost. In addition, our customers may elect to repair or replace the warrantied item by using the services of another provider and require us to pay for the cost of the repair or replacement. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business, and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. As a result, higher fuel costs may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments, underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our results of operations fluctuate seasonally. Our revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, extended periods of adverse weather impact our operations. Adverse weather is most likely to occur during the winter season, our fiscal quarters ending in January and April. In addition, a disproportionate percentage of paid holidays fall within the fiscal quarter ending in January, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience periods of reduced revenue and profitability during our fiscal quarters ending in January and April.Our financial results include certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, accrued insurance claims, income taxes, accruals for contingencies, including legal matters, recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings under the percentage of completion method of accounting, allowance for doubtful accounts, and stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards. In some instances, we must exercise significant judgment for these estimates. At the time they are made, we believe that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements. Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. We regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may divert management’s attention from our existing business and expose us to operational challenges and risks, including retaining management and other key employees; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems; assumption of unknown liabilities or liabilities for which inadequate reserves have been established; consolidating corporate 12Table of Contentsand administrative infrastructures; and failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Fluctuations in our tax obligations and effective tax rate may cause volatility in our operating results. We are subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions in which we operate and we determine and provide for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction. Changes in the mix and level of earnings among jurisdictions could materially impact our effective tax rate in a financial statement period. We are also subject to tax audits by various taxing authorities. During fiscal 2016, we were notified by the Internal Revenue Service that our federal income tax return for fiscal 2014 was selected for examination. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. We believe our tax positions are properly supported, although the final timing and resolution of tax examinations are subject to uncertainty as the taxing authorities may disagree with our positions. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax regulations or changes to existing accounting rules. For example, FASB Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (“ASU 2016-09”), which is effective for us beginning with the fiscal quarter ending October 28, 2017, will likely result in increased volatility in our income tax provision. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies, in Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K for additional information regarding ASU 2016-09. Any of the factors described above could cause volatility in our operating results or otherwise impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Our bank credit facility imposes restrictions that may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions. We have a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $450.0 million revolving facility, $385.0 million in aggregate term loan facilities, and contains a sublimit of $200.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. As of July 29, 2017, we had $367.7 million outstanding under the term loans and $48.7 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement. We did not have any outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility as of July 29, 2017. The credit agreement contains covenants that restrict or limit our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make investments or create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell certain assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit agreement requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. These covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed. In addition, a default under our credit agreement could result in the acceleration of our obligations under both the credit agreement and the indenture governing our $485.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2021 as a result of cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions.The convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock. In connection with the issuance of our 0.75% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2021 (the “Notes”), we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlay the Notes sold in the offering. We also entered into separate, privately negotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.The hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions from time to time. They may do so by purchasing and/or selling shares of our common stock and/or other securities of ours, including the Notes, in privately-negotiated transactions and/or open-market transactions or by entering into and/or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The hedge counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes or following any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) repurchase date. The effect, if any, of these transactions on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or to discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be at their sole discretion and not within our control.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. The hedge counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that they might default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties is unsecured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in failure or financial difficulties for many financial institutions. If a hedge counterparty becomes subject 13Table of Contentsto insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase in correlation to the increase in the market price and volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any hedge counterparty.Conversion of the Notes or exercise of the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes. At our election, we may settle Notes tendered for conversion entirely or partly in shares of our common stock. Further, the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions are expected to be settled on a net-share basis. As a result, the conversion of some or all of the Notes or the exercise of some or all of such warrants may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion of the Notes or such exercise of the warrants could adversely affect the then-prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated, and new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the profitability of our specialty contracting services. The Federal Communications Commission regulates many of our telecommunications customers and may alter its application of current regulations and impose additional regulations. If existing or new regulations adversely affect our telecommunications customers and the profitability of the services they provide, our customers may reduce expenditures, which could affect the demand for specialty contracting services. We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters. Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and work near high voltage lines, subjecting them and others to potential injury or death. If any of our workers or other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations, resulting in a fine or, in extreme cases, criminal sanction. In addition, if our safety record were to deteriorate substantially over time, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event we cause or are responsible for a release of hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Liabilities for contamination or exposure to hazardous materials, or failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, could result in significant costs including clean-up costs, fines, criminal sanctions for violations, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. These costs as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations. We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth. Using cash for operational growth, capital expenditures, share repurchases, or acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing credit agreement contains significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt. In addition, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate because of changes in business requirements. Our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time because of changes in our business. Increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations. Increases in our health care costs could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. The costs of employee health care have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. We retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, under our employee group health care plan. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Laws”) have had a significant impact on employers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry, and are expected to continue to increase our employee health care costs. This legislation requires employers like us to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties. To avoid the penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage. Because of the breadth and complexity of these laws, as well as other health care reform legislation considered by Congress and state 14Table of Contentslegislations, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on us. A continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of the Health Care Reform Laws or other future health care reform laws imposed by Congress or state legislations could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.Several of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans under which we could incur material liabilities in certain circumstances. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, several of our subsidiaries participate in various multiemployer pension plans that provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. Because of the nature of multiemployer plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to providing benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”), absent an applicable exemption, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon withdrawal from a plan for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liability. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate become significantly underfunded, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions in the form of higher contribution rates or surcharges related to the underfunding of those plans.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, one of our subsidiaries ceased operations. This subsidiary previously contributed to a multiemployer pension plan, the Pension, Hospitalization and Benefit Plan of the Electrical Industry - Pension Trust Fund (the “Plan”). In October 2016, the Plan demanded payment for a claimed withdrawal liability of approximately $13.0 million. In December 2016, we submitted a formal request to the Plan seeking review of the Plan’s withdrawal liability determination. We are disputing the claim of a withdrawal liability demanded by the Plan as we believe there is a statutory exemption available under ERISA for multiemployer pension plans that primarily cover employees in the building and construction industry. The Plan has taken the position that the work at issue does not qualify for the statutory exemption. We have submitted this dispute to arbitration, as required by ERISA, with a hearing expected sometime in 2018. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in asserting the statutory exemption as a defense in the arbitration proceeding. As required by ERISA, in November 2016, the subsidiary began making monthly payments of a withdrawal liability to the Plan in the amount of approximately $0.1 million. If we prevail in disputing the withdrawal liability all such payments will be refunded to us.Failure to protect critical data and technology systems adequately could materially affect our operations. We use our own information technology systems as well as those of business partners to manage our operations and other business processes and to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. Third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance or other irregularities may compromise our measures to protect these systems and may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our or our customers’ data or accounts. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2017, our common stock fluctuated from a low of $71.34 per share to a high of $108.99 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;•announcements by our customers regarding their capital spending and start-up, deferral or cancellation of projects;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and•the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.In addition, factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws 15Table of Contentsalso restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. Lastly, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control"
13,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2016-08-31,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns affecting the industries we serve. Demand for our services has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry. During times of uncertain or slowing economic conditions, our customers often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. In addition, uncertain or adverse economic conditions that create volatility in the credit and equity markets may reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers causing them to reduce capital spending. Any reduction in capital spending or deferral or cancellation of projects by our customers could reduce demand for our services, adversely affecting our operations, cash flows, and liquidity. In addition, these conditions make it difficult to estimate our customers’ demand for our services and add uncertainty to the determination of our backlog. 8Table of ContentsWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts which may be canceled by our customers upon notice, do not guaranty a specific amount of work, or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms. During fiscal 2016, we derived approximately 81.0% of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts. The majority of these contracts are cancelable by our customers upon notice regardless of whether or not we are in default. In addition, our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements. Consequently, projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed with us and the work completed. This makes it difficult to estimate our customers’ demand for our services. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of these contracts upon expiration of their terms. We may not be able to renew a contract if our competitors reduce their prices and underbid us in order to procure business, or we could be required to lower the price charged for work under the contract being rebid in order to retain the contract. The loss of work obtained through master service agreements and long-term contracts or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.The telecommunications industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid technological, structural, and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues. We generate the majority of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer demands. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce the need for our services by enabling telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. New, developing, or existing services could displace the wireline or wireless systems that we install and that our customers use to deliver services to consumers and businesses. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer due to technological changes could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers through industry consolidation or otherwise could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers in each of fiscal 2016, 2015, and 2014 accounting for approximately 69.7%, 61.1% and 58.3% of our total revenues, respectively. Revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period to period depending on the timing or volume of work that those customers order or perform with their in-house service organizations. Our revenue could significantly decline if we were to lose one or more of our significant customers or if one or more of our customers were to elect to do the work we provide with their in-house service teams or shift a significant portion of that work to another service provider. Additionally, the telecommunications industry has been characterized by consolidation. In the case of a consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer, the amount of work we receive could be reduced if procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity change from those of the existing customer or the surviving entity chooses to use a different service provider. The loss of work from a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous small, privately owned companies, as well as several large corporations that may have financial, technical, and marketing resources exceeding ours. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. Any organization may become a competitor if they have adequate financial resources, access to technical expertise, and the necessary equipment and materials. Additionally, our competitors may develop expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior to our services in both price and quality, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in bidding on projects, if our ability to win projects requires that we settle for reduced margins or if our customers reduce the amount of specialty contracting services that are outsourced.Our profitability is based on our delivering services within the estimated costs established when pricing our contracts. We perform a majority of our services under master service agreements and other agreements that contain customer-specified service requirements, such as discrete pricing for individual tasks. Revenue is recognized under these arrangements based on units-of-delivery as each unit is completed. Due to the fixed price nature of these contracts, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates. The remainder of our services, representing less than 5% of our contract revenues during fiscal 2016 and less than 10% of our contract revenues during each of fiscal 2015 and 2014, are performed under contracts using the cost-to-cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting. Revenue is recognized under these arrangements based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract. The cost estimation process is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and 9Table of Contentsfinancial professionals. Due to the fixed price nature of our contracts, any changes in original cost estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may result in changes to costs, thereby reducing our profitability. We recognize these changes in the period in which they are determined, potentially resulting in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, which could become uncollectible. We extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing for that work. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and regularly monitor the timeliness of their payments. However, slowing conditions in the industries we serve, bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. As of July 30, 2016, we had net accounts receivable of $328.0 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $377.0 million. The failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our expected cash flows and adversely affect our liquidity and profitability.We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance-related liabilities. Within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability, workers’ compensation, employee group health, and damages associated with underground facility locating services. We are self-insured for the majority of all claims because most claims against us fall below the deductibles under our insurance policies. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors not known with precision. These factors include the estimated development of claims, the payment pattern of claims incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations. Should the cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 8, Accrued Insurance Claims, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation. Our backlog consists of the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contractual obligations with our customers. Our backlog estimates represent amounts under master service agreements and other contractual agreements for services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts and are based on contract terms, our historical experience with customers and, more generally, our experience in similar procurements. The significant majority of our backlog estimates comprise services under master service agreements and long-term contracts. Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change because of project accelerations, contract cancellations, or delays due to various factors, including, but not limited to, commercial issues such as permitting, engineering changes, incremental documentation requirements, difficult job site conditions, and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue to be realized in different periods or in different amounts from those originally reflected in backlog. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract and may cancel a contract for convenience. Our estimates of a customer’s requirements during a particular future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenues and earnings.We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC Topic 350”). Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, reporting units are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized. Any such write-down would adversely affect our results of operations.The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand and the level of overall economic activity, including in particular construction and housing activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects during times of slowing economic conditions. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers may also cause results to vary. These factors may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units could decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.10Table of ContentsWe may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we are involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract or property damage. In addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of current legal proceedings, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries who have many years of experience in our industry. The loss of any one of them could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy, adversely affecting our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers and other key employees, we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time. We do not carry “key-person” life insurance on any of our employees.Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to employ, train, and retain skilled personnel is necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for employees possessing the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees. In addition, our labor costs may increase when there is a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel and we may be unable to pass these increases on to our customers due to the long-term nature of our contracts, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. We may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations to us. We contract with independent subcontractors to help manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amount that we would otherwise expend on fixed assets and working capital. If we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all, we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs in order to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by subcontractors. Any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain contracts and our relationship with our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. The nature of our business exposes us to warranty claims, which may reduce our profitability. We typically warrant the services we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and the material we supply. Historically, warranty claims have not been material as our customers evaluate much of the work we perform for defects shortly after work is completed. However, if warranty claims occur, we could be required to repair or replace warrantied items at our cost. In addition, our customers may elect to repair or replace the warrantied item by using the services of another provider and require us to pay for the cost of the repair or replacement. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business, and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. As a result, higher fuel costs may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments, underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. 11Table of ContentsOur results of operations fluctuate seasonally. Our revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, extended periods of adverse weather impact our operations. Adverse weather is most likely to occur during the winter season, our second and third fiscal quarters. In addition, a disproportionate percentage of paid holidays fall within our second fiscal quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we are most likely to experience periods of reduced revenue and profitability during our second and third fiscal quarters.Our financial results include certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, accrued insurance claims, income taxes, accruals for contingencies, including legal matters, recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings under the percentage of completion method of accounting, allowance for doubtful accounts, and stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards. In some instances, we must exercise significant judgment for these estimates. At the time they are made, we believe that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements. Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. We regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may divert management’s attention from our existing business and expose us to operational challenges and risks, including retaining management and other key employees; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems; assumption of unknown liabilities or liabilities for which inadequate reserves have been established; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the United States and Canada and certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income to different jurisdictions. Changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax laws may adversely affect our effective tax rate. An increase to our effective tax rate may increase our tax obligations. In addition, the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.Our bank credit facility imposes restrictions that may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions. We have a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $450.0 million revolving facility, $350.0 million in aggregate term loan facilities, and contains a sublimit of $200.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. As of July 30, 2016, we had $346.3 million outstanding under the term loans and $57.6 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement. We did not have any outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility as of July 30, 2016. The credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make investments or create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell certain assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit agreement requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. These covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed. In addition, a default under our credit agreement could result in the acceleration of our obligations under both the credit agreement and the indenture governing our $485.0 million of 0.75% convertible senior notes due September 15, 2021 (the “Notes”) as a result of cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions.The convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock. In connection with the issuance of our Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions with the hedge counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlay the Notes sold in the offering. We also entered into separate, privately 12Table of Contentsnegotiated warrant transactions with the hedge counterparties relating to the same number of shares of our common stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments.The hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may modify their hedge positions with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions from time to time. They may do so by purchasing and/or selling shares of our common stock and/or other securities of ours, including the Notes, in privately-negotiated transactions and/or open-market transactions or by entering into and/or unwinding various over-the-counter derivative transactions with respect to our common stock. The hedge counterparties are likely to modify their hedge positions during any observation period related to a conversion of the Notes or following any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes) repurchase date. The effect, if any, of these transactions on the market price of our common stock will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, the hedge counterparties and/or their affiliates may choose to engage in, or to discontinue engaging in, any of these transactions with or without notice at any time, and their decisions will be at their sole discretion and not within our control.We are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions. The hedge counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that they might default under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the hedge counterparties is unsecured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have from time to time resulted in failure or financial difficulties for many financial institutions. If a hedge counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with that counterparty. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase in correlation to the increase in the market price and volatility of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by a hedge counterparty, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any hedge counterparty.Conversion of the Notes or exercise of the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions may dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes. At our election, we may settle Notes tendered for conversion entirely or partly in shares of our common stock. Further, the warrants evidenced by the warrant transactions are expected to be settled on a net-share basis. As a result, the conversion of some or all of the Notes or the exercise of some or all of such warrants may dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion of the Notes or such exercise of the warrants could adversely affect the then-prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated, and new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the profitability of our specialty contracting services. The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates many of our telecommunications customers and may alter its application of current regulations and impose additional regulations. If existing or new regulations adversely affect our telecommunications customers and the profitability of the services they provide, our customers may reduce expenditures, which could affect the demand for specialty contracting services. We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters. Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and work near high voltage lines, subjecting them and others to potential injury or death. If any of our workers or other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations, resulting in a fine or, in extreme cases, criminal sanction. In addition, if our safety record were to deteriorate substantially over time, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event we cause or are responsible for a release of hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Liabilities for contamination or exposure to hazardous materials, or failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, could result in significant costs including clean-up costs, fines, criminal sanctions for violations, and third-party claims for property damage or personal injury. These costs as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations. 13Table of ContentsWe may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth. Using cash for operational growth, capital expenditures, share repurchases, or acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt. In addition, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate because of changes in business requirements. Our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time because of changes in our business. Increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations. Increases in our health care costs could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. The costs of employee health care have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. We retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, under our employee group health care plan. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Laws”) have had a significant impact on employers, insurers and others associated with the health care industry, and are expected to continue to increase our employee health care costs. This legislation requires certain employers like the Company to offer health care benefits to full-time employees or face potential annual penalties. To avoid the penalties, employers must offer health benefits providing a minimum level of coverage and limit the amount that employees are charged for the coverage. Because of the breadth and complexity of these laws, as well as other health care reform legislation considered by Congress and state legislations, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on us. A continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of the Health Care Reform Laws or other future health care reform laws imposed by Congress or state legislations could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.Several of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans under which we could incur material liabilities in certain circumstances. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, several of our subsidiaries participate in various multiemployer pension plans that generally provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. Because of the nature of multiemployer plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, absent an applicable exemption, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon termination or withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan’s unfunded vested liability. One of our subsidiaries, which previously contributed to the Pension, Hospitalization and Benefit Plan of the Electrical Industry - Pension Trust Fund (the “Plan”), a multiemployer pension plan, ceased operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We do not expect to be assessed a withdrawal liability under the Plan because we believe there is a statutory exemption available under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act for multiemployer pension plans that primarily cover employees in the building and construction industry. However, there can be no assurance that the Plan will not make a claim for withdrawal liability or that, if made, we will be successful in asserting the statutory exemption as a defense. In such instance, payment of the withdrawal liability could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate become underfunded as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions related to the underfunding of those plans.Failure to protect critical data and technology systems adequately could materially affect our operations. We use our own information technology systems as well as those of business partners to manage our operations and other business processes and to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. Third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance or other irregularities may compromise our measures to protect these systems and may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our or our customers’ data or accounts. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2016, our common stock fluctuated from a low of $48.61 per share to a high of $95.94. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;•announcements by our customers regarding their capital spending and start-up, deferral or cancellation of projects;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and14Table of Contents•the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.In addition, factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. Lastly, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control"
12,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2015-09-04,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns affecting the industries we serve. Demand for our services has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry. During times of uncertain or slowing economic conditions, our customers often reduce their 8Table of Contentscapital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. In addition, uncertain or adverse economic conditions that create volatility in the credit and equity markets may reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers causing them to reduce capital spending. Any reduction in capital spending or deferral or cancellation of projects by our customers could reduce demand for our services, adversely affecting our operations, cash flows, and liquidity. These conditions make it difficult to estimate our customers' demand for our services and add uncertainty to the determination of our backlog. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts which may be canceled by our customers upon notice, may not guaranty a specific amount of work, or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms. During fiscal 2015, we derived approximately 79.9% of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts. The majority of these contracts are cancellable by our customers upon notice regardless of whether or not we are in default. In addition, our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements. Consequently, projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed with us and the work completed. This makes it difficult to estimate our customers' demand for our services. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of these contracts upon expiration of their terms. We may not be able to renew a contract if our competitors reduce their prices and underbid us in order to procure business, or we could be required to lower the price charged for work under the contract being rebid in order to retain the contract. The loss of work obtained through master service agreements and long-term contracts or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.The telecommunications industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid technological, structural, and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues. We generate the majority of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer demands. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers could reduce the need for our services by enabling telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. New, developing, or existing services could displace the wireline or wireless systems that we install and that our customers use to deliver services to consumers and businesses. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer due to technological changes could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers through industry consolidation or otherwise could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers accounting for approximately 61.1%, 58.3% and 58.5% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period to period depending on the timing or volume of work that those customers order or perform with their in-house service organizations. Our revenue could significantly decline if we were to lose one or more of our significant customers or if one or more of our customers elect to do the work we provide with their in-house service teams. Additionally, the telecommunications industry has been characterized by consolidation. In the case of a consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer, the amount of work we receive could be reduced if procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity changes from that of the existing customer or the surviving entity uses a different service provider. The loss of work from a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous small, privately owned companies, as well as several large corporations that may have financial, technical, and marketing resources exceeding ours. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. Any organization may become a competitor if they have adequate financial resources, access to technical expertise, and the necessary equipment and materials. Additionally, our competitors may develop expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior to our services in both price and quality, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in bidding on projects, if our ability to win projects requires that we settle for lesser margins or if our customers reduce the amount of specialty contracting services that are outsourced.Our profitability is based on our delivering services within the estimated costs established when pricing our contracts. We recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units-of-delivery or cost-to-cost measures. For the majority of our contracts, we recognize revenue as each unit is completed under the units-of-delivery percentage of completion method. Due to the fixed price nature of these contracts, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates. Under the cost-to-cost measure of completion, we recognize revenue based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of 9Table of Contentscompletion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract. The cost estimation process is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals. Any changes in original cost estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may result in changes to costs and income. We recognize these changes in the period in which they are determined, potentially resulting in significant changes to previously reported results. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, which could become uncollectible. We extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing for that work. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and regularly monitor the timeliness of their payments. However, slowing conditions in the industries we serve, bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. As of July 25, 2015, we had net accounts receivable of $315.1 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $274.7 million. The failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our expected cash flows and adversely affect our liquidity and profitability.We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related liabilities. Within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability, workers' compensation, employee group health, and damages associated with underground facility locating services. We are self-insured for the majority of all claims because most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors not known with precision. These factors include the estimated development of claims, the payment pattern of claims incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations. Should the cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 8, Accrued Insurance Claims, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation. Our backlog consists of the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contractual obligations with our customers. Our backlog estimates represent amounts under master service agreements and other contractual agreements for services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts and are based on contract terms, our historical experience with customers and, more generally, our experience in similar procurements. The significant majority of our backlog estimates comprise services under master service agreements and long-term contracts. Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change because of project accelerations, cancellations, or delays due to various factors, including but not limited to commercial issues and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue to be realized in different periods or in different amounts from those originally reflected in backlog. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract and may cancel a contract for convenience. Our estimates of a customer's requirements during a particular future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenues and earnings.We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standard Codification (""ASC"") Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (""ASC Topic 350""). Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, reporting units are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized. Any such write-down would adversely affect our results of operations.The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand and the level of overall economic activity, including in particular construction and housing activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects during times of slowing economic conditions. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers may also cause results to vary. These factors may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units 10Table of Contentscould decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers' compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract or property damage. In addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of current legal proceedings, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries who have many years of experience in our industry. The loss of any one of them could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy, adversely affecting our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers and other key employees, we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time. We do not carry ""key-person"" life insurance on any of our employees.Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to employ, train, and retain skilled personnel is necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for employees possessing the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees. In addition, our labor costs may increase when there is a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel and these increases may not be able to be passed on to our customers due to the long term nature of our contracts, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. We may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations. We contract with independent subcontractors to help manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amount that we may otherwise be required to expend on fixed assets and working capital. If we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all, we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs in order to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by subcontractors. Any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. The nature of our business exposes us to warranty claims, which may reduce our profitability. We typically warrant the services we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and the material we supply. Historically, warranty claims have not been material as our customers evaluate much of the work we perform for defects shortly after work is completed. However, if warranty claims occur, we could be required to repair or replace warrantied items at our cost. In addition, our customers may elect to repair or replace the warrantied item by using the services of another provider and require us to pay for the cost of the repair or replacement. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business, and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. As a result, higher fuel costs may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments, underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions, declines 11Table of Contentsin fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our results of operations fluctuate seasonally. Our revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, extended periods of adverse weather impact our operations. Adverse weather is most likely to occur during the winter, our second and third fiscal quarters. In addition, a disproportionate percentage of paid holidays fall within our second fiscal quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we may experience periods of reduced revenue and profitability. These periods are most likely to occur in the second and/or third quarters of our fiscal year.Our financial results include certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data. In some instances, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings under the percentage of completion method of accounting, allowance for doubtful accounts, the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, accrued insurance claims, income taxes, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, and accruals for contingencies, including legal matters. At the time they are made, we believe that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements. Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. We regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may divert management's attention from our existing business and expose us to operational challenges and risks, including retaining management and other key employees; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems; assumption of unknown liabilities or liabilities for which inadequate reserves have been established; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the United States and Canada and certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income to different jurisdictions. Changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax laws may adversely affect our effective tax rate. An increase to our effective tax rate may increase our tax obligations. In addition, the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.The indenture under which our senior subordinated notes were issued and our bank credit facility impose restrictions that may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions. As of July 25, 2015, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $277.5 million in senior subordinated notes due 2021. We also have a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $150 million term loan and a $450 million revolving facility, including a sublimit of $200 million for the issuance of letters of credit. As of July 25, 2015, we had $95.3 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility, $150.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $54.4 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement. The terms of our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make investments or create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell certain assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit agreement requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. A default under our credit agreement or the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes could result in the acceleration of our obligations under either or both of those instruments as a result of cross acceleration and cross default provisions. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.12Table of ContentsMany of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated, and new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the profitability of our specialty contracting service. The Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) regulates many of our telecommunications customers and may alter its application of current regulations and impose additional regulations. If existing or new regulations adversely affect our telecommunications customers and the profitability of the services they provide, our customers may reduce expenditures, which could affect the demand for specialty contracting services. We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters. Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and work near high voltage lines, subjecting them and others to potential injury or death. If any of our workers or other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations, resulting in a fine or, in extreme cases, criminal sanction. In addition, if our safety record were to deteriorate substantially over time, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event we cause or are responsible for a release of hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Liabilities for contamination or exposure to hazardous materials, or failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs including clean-up costs, fines, criminal sanctions for violations, and third party claims for property damage or personal injury. These costs as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations. We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth. Using cash for operational growth, capital expenditures, share repurchases, or acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt. In addition, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate because of changes in business requirements. Our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time because of changes in our business. Increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations. Increases in our health insurance costs could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. The costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. Additionally, we may incur additional costs because of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ""Health Care Reform Laws""). Provisions of these laws have become and will become effective in calendar 2015 and at various dates over the next several years. Because of the breadth and complexity of these laws, the lack of regulations and guidance on implementation, and the phased-in nature of the new regulations, as well as other health care reform legislation considered by Congress and state legislations, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on us. A continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of the Health Care Reform Laws or other future health care reform laws imposed by Congress or state legislations could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.Several of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans under which we could incur material liabilities in certain circumstances. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, several of our subsidiaries participate in various multiemployer pension plans that generally provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. Because of the nature of multiemployer plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, absent an applicable exception, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon termination or withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested liability. We currently do not intend to withdraw from any multiemployer plan in which we participate. However, a future withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate could result in a material withdrawal liability to the extent that any unfunded vested liability under such plan is allocable to the Company. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate becomes underfunded as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions related to the underfunding of those plans.13Table of ContentsFailure to protect critical data and technology systems adequately could materially affect our operations. We use our own information technology systems as well as those of our business partners to maintain certain data and provide reports. Third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance or other irregularity may compromise our measures to protect these systems and may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our or our customers' data or accounts. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2015, our common stock fluctuated from a low of $25.67 per share to a high of $69.62. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and•the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.In addition, factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. Lastly, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control"
11,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2014-09-09,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns affecting the industries we serve. Demand for our services has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry. During times of uncertain or slowing economic conditions, our customers often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. In addition, our customers generally finance their projects through cash flow from operations, the issuance of debt, or the issuance of equity. Uncertain or adverse economic conditions that create volatility in the credit and equity markets could reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers. As a result of the foregoing, demand for our services may decline during periods of economic uncertainty or weakness adversely affecting our operations, cash flows and liquidity. In addition, this makes it difficult to estimate our customers' demand for our services and adds uncertainty to the determination of our backlog.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts which may be canceled by our customers upon notice or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms. During fiscal 2014, we derived approximately 78.9% of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts. By their terms, the majority of these contracts may be canceled by our customers upon notice regardless of whether or not we are in default. In addition, our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements. Consequently, projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed with us and the work completed. This makes it difficult to estimate our customers' demand for our services and adds uncertainty to the determination of our backlog. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of these contracts. Accordingly, we may be underbid by our competitors if they elect to reduce their prices in order to procure business or we could be required to lower the price charged under a contract being rebid. The loss of work obtained through master service agreements and long-term contracts or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. The industries we serve have experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid technological, structural and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues. The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer demands. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. New, 8Table of Contentsdeveloping, or existing services could displace the wireline or wireless systems that we install and that are used by our customers to deliver services to consumers and businesses. Additionally, the telecommunications industry we serve has been characterized by consolidation that may result in the loss of one or more customers. In addition, improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers accounting for approximately 58.3%, 58.5% and 59.6% of our total revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. If we were to lose one or more of our significant customers, our revenue may significantly decline. In addition, revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period-to-period depending on the timing or volume of work which those customers order or perform with their in-house service organizations. Additionally, the consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer may result in a change in procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity which could reduce the amount of work we receive. The loss of work from a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous small, privately owned companies, as well as several companies that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and, as a result, any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. Additionally, our competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in bidding on projects, if our ability to win projects requires that we settle for lesser margins or if our customers reduce the amount of specialty contracting services that are outsourced.Our financial results are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data. In some instances, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings under the percentage of completion method of accounting, allowance for doubtful accounts, the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, accrued insurance claims, income taxes, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, and accruals for contingencies, including legal matters. At the time they are made, we believe that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements. Our profitability is based on our delivering services within the estimated costs established when pricing our contracts. We recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units-of-delivery or cost-to-cost measures. A significant majority of our contracts are based on units-of-delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed. As the price for each of the units is fixed by the contract, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates. Revenues from contracts using the cost-to-cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires that we estimate the costs to be incurred in performing the contract. Our process for estimating costs is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals. Any changes in original cost estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may result in changes to costs and income. These changes would be recognized in the period in which they are determined and could result in significant changes to previously reported profits. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. We extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing our customers for that work. These customers include telephone companies, cable television multiple system operators, and gas and electric utilities and others. We 9Table of Contentsperiodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments. Slowing conditions in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis or at all. At July 26, 2014, we had net accounts receivable of $272.7 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $230.6 million. The failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our expected cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability.Our accounts receivable include approximately $20.1 million for past due balances from a customer on a rural project funded primarily by the Rural Utilities Service agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (the “RUS”) under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The loan made by the RUS is secured by certain assets of the customer. We have stopped work on the project. We have filed construction liens with respect to work on the project representing approximately $17.7 million of the accounts receivable balance. In addition, other creditors have also filed construction liens against the customer. In July 2014, we were included in an action taken by another creditor that has filed a construction lien on one parcel of property owned by the customer to foreclose the lien on that parcel. In the event the customer does not pay the balances owed, the amount we collect through the enforcement of our liens or other actions will depend on the value realized on the assets underlying the liens as well as the amount owed to, and priority of, other creditors.We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related liabilities. We retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for claims related to automobile liability, general liability, workers' compensation, employee group health, and damages relating to underground facility locating services. We are self-insured for the majority of all claims because most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors that cannot be known with precision. These factors include the estimated number of future claims, the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations. Should a greater number of claims occur compared to what we have estimated, or should the dollar amount or cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 8, Accrued Insurance Claims, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job-specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other contracts. Many of our contracts are multi-year agreements, and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and, more generally, our experience in procurements of this type. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract or can cancel a contract for convenience. Therefore our estimates of a customer's requirements during a particular future period may prove to be inaccurate. In addition, revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of project accelerations or delays due to various factors, including but not limited to commercial issues and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue amounts to be realized in periods and at levels different than originally projected. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenues and earnings.We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standard Codification (""ASC"") Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (""ASC Topic 350""). Our reporting units' goodwill and other related indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, reporting units are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized. Any such write-down adversely affects our results of operations. As a result of the fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 annual impairment analyses, we concluded that no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset was indicated at any reporting unit.Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the level of overall economic activity. Individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole. Specifically, during times of slowing economic conditions, our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or 10Table of Contentscancel pending projects. As a result, demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline which could adversely affect our operations, cash flow, and liquidity, and could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions that are brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers' compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract or property damage. In addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, because plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, regardless of the outcome, these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of current legal proceedings, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our business. We depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries. Our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry, and the loss of any one of them could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers and other key employees, we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time. We do not carry significant ""key-person"" life insurance on any of our employees. Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for employees possessing the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees. In addition, our labor costs may increase when there is a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. We may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations. We utilize independent subcontractors to complete work on a portion of our projects and to manage workflow. If we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all, we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs in order to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by subcontractors. Any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. The nature of our business exposes us to warranty claims, which may reduce our profitability. We typically warrant the services we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and the material we supply. Historically, warranty claims have not been material as much of the work we perform is evaluated by our customers for defects shortly after work is completed. However, if warranty claims occur, we could be required to repair or replace warrantied items at our cost. In addition, our customers may elect to repair or replace the warrantied item by using the services of another provider. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business, and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. As a result, higher fuel costs may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments, underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions, declines 11Table of Contentsin fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our results of operations fluctuate seasonally. Our revenues exhibit seasonality as a significant portion of our work is performed outdoors. Consequently, our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather which are more likely to occur during the winter season, impacting our second and third fiscal quarters. Also, a disproportionate percentage of paid holidays fall within our second fiscal quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Additionally, our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year-end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period. As a result, we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year. Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement or diversify our business. We regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may divert management's attention from our existing business and expose us to operational challenges and risks, including retaining management and other key employees; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems; assumption of unknown liabilities or liabilities for which inadequate reserves have been established; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the United States and Canada and certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income to different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax laws. An increase to our effective tax rate may increase our tax obligations. In addition, the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.The indenture under which our senior subordinated notes were issued and our bank credit facility impose restrictions which may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions. At July 26, 2014, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $277.5 million in senior subordinated notes due 2021. We also have a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $125 million term loan and a $275 million revolving facility, including a sublimit of $150 million for the issuance of letters of credit. At July 26, 2014, we had $63.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility, $114.1 million outstanding under the term loan and $49.4 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement. The terms of our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends; redeem or repurchase our capital stock; incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; make investments or create liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with another entity; sell certain assets; and enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit agreement requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. A default under our credit agreement or the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes could result in the acceleration of our obligations under either or both of those instruments as a result of cross acceleration and cross default provisions. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed. Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated, and new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the profitability of our specialty contracting service. Many of our telecommunications customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (""FCC""). The FCC may alter its application of current regulations and may impose additional regulations. If existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our telecommunications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide, our customers may reduce expenditures which could impact the demand for specialty contracting services. We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters. Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and work near high voltage lines. As a result, they and others are subject to potential injury and death. If any of our workers or any other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations, which could result in a fine or, in extreme cases, criminal sanction. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. 12Table of ContentsOur failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event we cause or are responsible for a release of hazardous substances or other environmental damage resulting from underground objects we encounter. Additionally, the environmental laws and regulations which relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean-up costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations. We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth. Using cash for operational growth, capital expenditures, share repurchases, or acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt. Also, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes in business requirements. Our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time as a result of changes in our business. Increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations. Increases in our health insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. The costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. Additionally, we may incur additional costs as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ""Health Care Reform Laws"") that were signed into law in March 2010. A continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of the Health Care Reform Laws could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Several of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans, which under certain circumstances could result in material liabilities being incurred. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, several of our subsidiaries participate in various multiemployer pension plans that generally provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. Because of the nature of multiemployer plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, absent an applicable exception, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon termination or withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested liability. We currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan in which we participate. However, a future withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate could result in a material withdrawal liability to the extent that any unfunded vested liability under such plan is allocable to the Company. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate becomes underfunded as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions related to the underfunding of those plans.Failure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations. We use our own information technology systems as well as those of our business partners to maintain certain data and provide reports. Our measures protecting these systems may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance or other irregularity, and may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our or our customers' data or accounts. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2014, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $33.52 per share to a low of $24.77 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and•the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.13Table of ContentsIn addition, factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. Lastly, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control"
16,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2013-09-13,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Uncertain economic conditions and/or challenges in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact our customers' future spending. The U.S. economy is still recovering from the recent recession, and growth in U.S. economic activity has remained slow. It is uncertain when these conditions will significantly improve. Economic downturns adversely impact the demand for our services and potentially result in the delay or cancellation of projects by our customers. This makes it difficult to estimate our customers' requirements for our services and adds uncertainty to the determination of our backlog. In addition, our customers generally finance their projects though cash flow from operations, the issuance of debt, or the issuance of equity. As a result, reduced cash flow from operations or volatility in the credit and equity markets could reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers. This may result in a reduction in our customers' spending for our services, which could adversely affect our operations as a result of less demand for our services or lower margins. Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns affecting the industries we serve. Demand for our services by telecommunications customers has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry. Our results for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 were impacted by customer reductions in near-term spending plans. Although we experienced an improved operating environment in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, there is no guarantee that future downturns will not occur. During times of slowing economic conditions, our customers often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. In addition, our underground facility locating services more generally are influenced by the level of overall economic activity. As a result of the foregoing, demand for our services may decline during periods of economic weakness adversely affecting our operations, cash flows and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts which may be canceled by our customers upon notice or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms. During fiscal 2013, we derived approximately 77.0% of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts. By their terms, the majority of these contracts may be canceled by our customers upon notice, regardless of whether or not we are in default. In addition, our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements. Consequently, projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed with us and the work completed. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of these contracts. Accordingly, we may be underbid by our competitors if they elect to reduce their prices in order to procure business or we could be required to lower the price charged under a contract being rebid. The loss of work obtained through master service agreements and long-term contracts or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. The industries we serve have experienced and may continue to experience rapid technological, structural and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues. The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer demands. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. New, developing, or existing services could displace the wireline or wireless systems that we install and that are used by our customers to deliver services to consumers and businesses. In addition, improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers accounting for approximately 58.5%, 59.6%, and 62.0% of our total revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. If we were to lose one or more of our significant customers, our revenue may significantly decline. In addition, revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period-to-period depending on the timing or volume of work which those customers order or perform with their in-house service organizations. Additionally, the consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer may result in a change in procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity which could reduce the amount of work we receive. The loss of work from a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. 9Table of ContentsThe specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous small, privately owned companies, as well as several companies that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and, as a result, any organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. Additionally, our competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future.Our financial results are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data. In some instances, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings under the percentage of completion method of accounting, allowance for doubtful accounts, the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, accrued insurance claims, income taxes, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, and accruals for contingencies, including legal matters. At the time they are made, we believe that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements. Our profitability is based on our delivering services within the estimated costs established when pricing our contracts. We recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units-of-delivery or cost-to-cost measures. A significant majority of our contracts are based on units-of-delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed. As the price for each of the units is fixed by the contract, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates. Revenues from contracts using the cost-to-cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires that we estimate the costs to be incurred in performing the contract. Our process for estimating costs is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals. Any changes in original cost estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may result in changes to costs and income. These changes would be recognized in the period in which they are determined and could result in significant changes to previously reported profits. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. We extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing our customers for that work. These customers include telephone companies, cable television multiple system operators, and gas and electric utilities and others. At July 27, 2013, we had net accounts receivable of $252.2 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $204.3 million. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments. Slowing conditions in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis or at all. The failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability. We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related liabilities. We retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for claims related to automobile liability, general liability, workers' compensation, employee group health, and locate damages. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims based on facts, circumstances and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors that cannot be known with precision. These factors include the estimated number of future claims, the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations. Should a greater number of claims occur compared to what we have estimated, or should the dollar amount or cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Policies – Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 8, Accrued Insurance Claims, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 10Table of ContentsOur backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation. Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job-specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other contracts. Many of our contracts are multi-year agreements, and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and, more generally, our experience in procurements of this type. Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change as a result of project accelerations, cancellations or delays due to various factors, including but not limited to commercial issues and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue amounts to be realized in periods and at levels different than originally projected.  In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract. Our estimates of a customer's requirements during a particular future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenues and earnings.We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We account for goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") Accounting Standard Codification (""ASC"") Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (""ASC Topic 350""). Our reporting units goodwill and other related indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed annually as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized. Any such write-down adversely affects our results of operations. Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. As a result of the fiscal 2013 annual impairment analysis, the Company concluded that no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset was indicated at any reporting unit. For businesses acquired in fiscal 2013, there were no significant changes in forecast assumptions between the initial valuation date and the annual impairment analysis. As a result, the estimated fair values determined during the fiscal 2013 annual impairment analysis approximated the reporting units' carrying values for the businesses acquired in fiscal 2013. Our UtiliQuest reporting unit, having a goodwill balance of approximately $35.6 million and an indefinite-lived trade name of $4.7 million, has been at lower operating levels as compared to historical levels. The fair value of the UtiliQuest reporting unit exceeds its carrying value by approximately 20%. The UtiliQuest reporting unit provides services to a broad range of customers including utilities and telecommunication providers. These services are required prior to underground excavation and are influenced by overall economic activity, including construction activity. The goodwill balance of this reporting unit may have an increased likelihood of impairment if a downturn in customer demand were to occur, or if the reporting unit were not able to execute against customer opportunities, and the long-term outlook for their cash flows were adversely impacted. Furthermore, changes in the long-term outlook for this reporting unit may result in changes to other valuation assumptions. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the level of overall economic activity. Individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole. Specifically, during times of slowing economic conditions, our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. As a result, demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline which could adversely affect our operations, cash flow, and liquidity, and could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions that are brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers' compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract or property damage.  In addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, because plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.  The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, regardless of the outcome, these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of current legal proceedings, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.11Table of ContentsThe loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our business. We depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries. Our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry, and the loss of any one of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time. We do not carry significant ""key-person"" life insurance on any of our employees. Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for employees possessing the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees. In addition, our labor costs may increase when there is a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. We may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations. We utilize independent subcontractors to complete work on a portion of our projects. If we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all, we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. Any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity. Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business, and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. As a result, higher fuel costs may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments, underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our results of operations fluctuate seasonally. Our revenues exhibit seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors. Consequently, our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather. Generally, inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters. Also, a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Additionally, our customer premise equipment installation activities historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period. As a result, we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year. We may be unable to generate internal growth. Our internal growth may be affected by, among other factors, our ability to offer the services our existing customers require, attract new customers, and hire and retain qualified employees or independent subcontractors. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth, such as the capital budgets of our customers and the availability of qualified employees, may be beyond our control. Should one or more of these factors occur, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business. Failure to combine and integrate the businesses acquired in fiscal 2013 into our operations in a successful and timely manner could adversely affect our business and results of operations. On December 3, 2012, we acquired substantially all of the telecommunications infrastructure service subsidiaries (the ""Acquired Subsidiaries"") of Quanta Services, Inc. Our integration of the Acquired Subsidiaries into our operations is a complex and time-consuming process which requires significant efforts and expenses. The difficulties of combining the businesses of the Acquired Subsidiaries with our operations includes, among others:•retaining and integrating management and other key employees;•unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;•consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;•minimizing the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns; and12Table of Contents•failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company.These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not realize the anticipated benefits of the purchase of the Acquired Subsidiaries even if they are successfully integrated into our operations. We purchased the Acquired Subsidiaries with the expectation that the acquisition would result in various benefits for the Company, including, among others, the strategic strengthening of our customer base, geographic scope, and technical service offerings, as well as the enhancement of our rural telecommunications engineering and construction capabilities. However, these anticipated benefits may not materialize if we are unable to capitalize on expected business opportunities due to competition or other factors, or general industry and business conditions deteriorate. If the anticipated benefits of the acquisition are not realized, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement or diversify our business. We regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including the diversion of management's attention from our existing business, the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves; and the potential impairment of acquired intangible assets. Our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position may be adversely affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the United States and Canada and certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income to different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax laws. An increase to our effective tax rate may increase our tax obligations. In addition, the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.The indenture under which our senior subordinated notes were issued and our bank credit facility impose restrictions which may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions. At July 27, 2013, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $277.5 million in senior subordinated notes due 2021 (the ""2021 Notes""). We also have a credit agreement (the ""Credit Agreement"") with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $125.0 million term loan (the ""Term Loan"") and a $275.0 million revolving facility, including a sublimit of $150.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. At July 27, 2013, we had $49.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility, $121.9 million outstanding under the Term Loan, and $46.7 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement. The terms of our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends; redeem or repurchase our capital stock; incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; make investments or create liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with another entity; sell certain assets; and enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. A default under our Credit Agreement or the indenture governing the 2021 Notes could result in the acceleration of our obligations under either or both of those agreements as a result of cross acceleration and cross default provisions. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed. Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated, and new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the profitability of our specialty contracting service. Many of our telecommunications customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (""FCC""). The FCC may alter its application of current regulations and may impose additional regulations. If existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our telecommunications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide, our customers may reduce expenditures which could impact the demand for specialty contracting services. We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters. Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and work near high voltage lines. As a result, they and others are subject to potential injury and death. If any of our workers or any other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations, which could result in a fine or, in extreme cases, criminal sanction. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business. 13Table of ContentsOur failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event we cause a release of hazardous substances or other environmental damage resulting from underground objects we encounter. Additionally, the environmental laws and regulations which relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean-up costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations. We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth. Using cash for operational growth, capital expenditures, share repurchases, or acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt. Also, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes in business requirements. Our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time as a result of changes in our business. Increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations. Increases in our health insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. The costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. Additionally, we may incur additional costs as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ""Health Care Reform Laws"") that were signed into law in March 2010. A continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of the Health Care Reform Laws could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations. Several of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans, which under certain circumstances could result in material liabilities being incurred. A few of our subsidiaries participate in various multiemployer pension plans under union and industry-wide agreements that generally provide defined pension benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. Because of the nature of multiemployer plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable, generally upon withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested liability. We currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan in which we participate. However, a future withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate could result in a material withdrawal liability to the extent that any unfunded vested liability under such plan is allocable to the Company.Failure to adequately protect critical data and technology systems could materially affect our operations. We use our own information technology systems as well as those of our business partners to maintain certain data and provide reports. Our measures protecting these systems may be compromised as a result of third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance or other irregularity, and may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our or our customers' data or accounts.  The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2013, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $26.77 per share to a low of $13.09 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to: •fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;•changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and•the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.14Table of ContentsIn addition, factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. Lastly, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control"
0,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2012-09-04,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or the Company’s other SEC filings, were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Uncertain economic conditions and/or challenges in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact our customers’ future spending.   The U.S. economy is still recovering from the recent recession, and growth in U.S. economic activity has remained slow. It is uncertain when these conditions will significantly improve. Economic downturns adversely impact the demand for our services and potentially result in the delay or cancellation of projects by our customers.  This makes it difficult to estimate our customers’ requirements for our services and adds uncertainty to the determination of our backlog.  In addition, our customers generally finance their projects though cash flow from operations, the issuance of debt, or the issuance of equity.  As a result, reduced cash flow from operations or volatility in the credit and equity markets could reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers.  This may result in a reduction in our customers’ spending for our services, which could adversely affect our operations as a result of less demand for our services or lower margins. Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns affecting the industries we serve.   Demand for our services by telecommunications customers has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry. Our results for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 were impacted by customer reductions in near-term spending plans.  Although we experienced an improved operating environment in fiscal 2012 and 2011, there is no guarantee that future downturns will not occur. During times of slowing economic conditions, our customers often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. In addition, our underground facility locating services are influenced by the level of overall economic activity. As a result of the foregoing, demand for our services may decline during periods of economic weakness adversely affecting our operations, cash flows and liquidity.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements which may be cancelled by our customers upon notice or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms.   During fiscal 2012, we derived approximately 70.3% of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts. By their terms, the majority of these contracts may be cancelled by our customers upon notice, regardless of whether or not we are in default. In addition, our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements. Consequently, projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed with us and the work completed. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of these contracts. As a result, we could be underbid by our competitors or required to lower the price charged under a contract being rebid. The loss of work obtained through master service agreements and long-term contracts or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. The industries we serve have experienced and may continue to experience rapid technological, structural and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues.   The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer demands. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. New, developing, or existing services, such as wireless applications, could displace the wireline systems that we install and that are used by our customers to deliver services to consumers and businesses. In addition, improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability.   Our customer base is highly concentrated. The top five customers accounted for approximately 59.6%, 61.9% and 66.3% of our total revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. If we were to lose one or more of our significant customers, our revenue may significantly decline. In addition, revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period-to-period depending on the timing or volume of work which those customers order or perform with their in-house service organizations. Additionally, the consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer may result in a change in procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity which could reduce the amount of work we receive. The loss of work from a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive.   We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous small, privately owned companies, as well as several companies that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and, as a result, any organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. Additionally, our competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the services that we provide.  Although our customers currently outsource a significant portion of these services to us and our industry competitors, we can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future.  8Table of Contents Our financial results are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.   In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.  These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data.  In some instances, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, income taxes, accrued insurance claims, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, and accruals for contingencies, including legal matters. At the time they are made, we believe that such estimates are fair based on the information available.  However, actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements. Our profitability is based on our delivering services within the estimated costs established when pricing our contracts.   We recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units-of-delivery or cost-to-cost measures.  A significant majority of our contracts are based on units-of-delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed. As the price for each of the units is fixed by the contract, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates. Revenues from contracts using the cost-to-cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires that we estimate the costs to be incurred in performing the contract. Our process for estimating costs is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals. Any changes in original cost estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may result in changes to costs and income. These changes would be recognized in the period in which they are determined and could result in significant changes to previously reported profits. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings.   We extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing our customers for that work.  These customers include telephone companies, cable television multiple system operators, and gas and electric utilities and others. At July 28, 2012, we had net accounts receivable of $141.8 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $127.3 million. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments. Slowing conditions in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis or at all. The failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability. We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related liabilities.   We retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for claims related to automobile liability, general liability, workers’ compensation, employee group health, and locate damages. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims based on facts, circumstances and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors that cannot be known with precision. These factors include the frequency of future claims, the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations. Should a greater number of claims occur compared to what we have estimated, or should the dollar amount or cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Accrued Insurance Claims” and Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our backlog is subject to reduction and/or cancellation.   Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job-specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other long-term requirements contracts. Many of our contracts are multi-year agreements, and we include in our backlog the services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and, more generally our experience in procurements of this type.  In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services. Our estimates of a customer’s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate.  If our estimated backlog is significantly inaccurate or does not result in future profits, this could adversely affect our future earnings and the price of our common stock.  9Table of Contents We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets.   We account for goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (“ASC Topic 350”). Our reporting units and related indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value.  In addition, they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value.  If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized.  Any such write-down could adversely affect our results of operations. The UtiliQuest reporting unit, having a goodwill balance of approximately $35.6 million and an indefinite-lived trade name of $4.7 million as of July 28, 2012, has recently been at lower operating levels compared to historical levels. The estimated fair value of the UtiliQuest reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, but the margin of excess has declined to less than 30.0%. The UtiliQuest reporting unit provides services to a broad range of customers, including utilities and telecommunication providers. These services are required prior to underground excavation and are influenced by overall economic activity, including construction activity.  The goodwill balance of this reporting unit may have an increased likelihood of impairment if a downturn in the current level of customer demand were to occur, or if the reporting unit were not able to execute against customer opportunities, and the long-term outlook for their cash flows were adversely impacted. Furthermore, changes in the long-term outlook may result in changes to other valuation assumptions. As a result of the fiscal 2012 annual impairment analysis, the Company concluded that no impairment of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset was indicated at any reporting unit. However, we recognized non-cash charges of $94.4 million, $9.7 million, $14.8 million and $29.0 million, respectively, as a result of the Company’s impairment analyses during fiscal 2009, 2008, 2006 and 2005. The impairment charges reduced the carrying value of goodwill related to these reporting units. Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units.  The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the level of overall economic activity. Individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole. Specifically, during times of slowing economic conditions, our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. As a result, demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline which could adversely affect our operations, cash flow, and liquidity, and could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions, including class action lawsuits, that are brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business.  These actions may seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers’ compensation, violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws, employment discrimination, breach of contract, property damage, punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief.  Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings.  The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  In addition, regardless of the outcome, these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of current legal proceedings, see “Legal Proceedings” and Note 17 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our business.   We depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries. Our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry, and the loss of any one of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy and adversely affect our operations.  Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time.  We do not carry significant “key-person” life insurance on any of our employees.Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.   Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for employees possessing the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees.  In addition, our labor costs may increase when there is a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. We may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations. We utilize independent subcontractors to complete work on a portion of our projects. If we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all, we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase.  In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they performed.  Any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.  10Table of Contents Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business, and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers.   Fuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. As a result, higher fuel costs may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.  Although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments, underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our results of operations fluctuate seasonally.   Our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors. Consequently, our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather. Generally, inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters. Also, a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Additionally, our customer premise equipment installation activities historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period. As a result of these factors, we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year. We may be unable to generate internal growth.   Our internal growth may be affected by, among other factors, our ability to offer the services our existing customers require, attract new customers, and hire and retain qualified employees or independent subcontractors. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth, such as the capital budgets of our customers and the availability of qualified employees, may be beyond our control. Should one or more of these factors occur, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business. Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations.   As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement or diversify our business. We regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including the diversion of management’s attention from our existing business, the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves; and the potential impairment of acquired intangible assets. Our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position may be adversely affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability.   We are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the United States and Canada and certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income to different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax laws. An increase to our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability.  In addition, the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. During fiscal 2012 we were notified by the Internal Revenue Service that our federal income tax return for a recent period was selected for examination. We believe our provision for income taxes is adequate; however, any significant assessment could affect our results of operations and cash flows. Our senior subordinated notes and revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions.   At July 28, 2012, we had $187.5 million in senior subordinated notes (the “Notes”) outstanding due 2021. We also have a revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a maximum borrowing of $225.0 million, including a sublimit of $100.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit.  At July 28, 2012, we had no outstanding borrowings and $38.5 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement. The terms of our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:  make certain payments, including the payment of dividends; redeem or repurchase our capital stock; incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; make investments or create liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with another entity; sell certain assets; and enter into transactions with affiliates.  In addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. A default under our Credit Agreement or the indenture governing the Notes could result in the acceleration of our obligations under either or both of those agreements as a result of cross acceleration and cross default provisions. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.  Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated, and new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the profitability of our specialty contracting service.   Many of our telecommunications customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”).  The FCC may alter the application of its current regulations and may impose additional regulations.  If existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our telecommunications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide, our customers may reduce expenditures which could impact the demand for specialty contracting services.  11Table of Contents We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters.   Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and work near high voltage lines. As a result, they and others are subject to potential injury.  If any of our workers or any other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations, which could result in a fine or, in extreme cases, criminal sanction.  In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award to us future business. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.   A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers. As a result, we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to encountering underground objects which may cause the release of hazardous substances. Additionally, the environmental laws and regulations which relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean-up costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations. We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth.   Using cash for operational growth, capital expenditures, share repurchases, or acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt. Also, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility.  If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes in business requirements.   Our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time as a result of changes in our business. Increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations. Increases in our health insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. The costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. Additionally, we may incur additional costs as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Laws”) that were signed into law in March 2010.  A continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of the Health Care Reform Laws could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.   During fiscal 2012, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $23.79 per share to a low of $12.59 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to:·fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;·announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;·changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and·the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services. In addition, factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control.   Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management.  For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors.  In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine.  The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. Lastly, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act.  These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control.  12Table of Contents "
5,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2011-09-02,"Risk Factors
.Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. If any of the risks  described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or the Company’s other SEC filings, were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Economic downturns and/or challenges in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact our customers’ future spending. We experienced a challenging business environment during fiscal 2009 and 2010 as a result of the economic slowdown and adverse developments in the financial and credit markets. Economic downturns may adversely impact the demand for our services and potentially result in the delay or cancellation of projects by our customers. This makes it difficult to estimate our customers’ requirements for our services and adds uncertainty to the determination of our backlog. Our customers generally finance their projects through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt, or the issuance of equity. As a result, volatility in the credit and equity markets could reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers. This may result in a reduction in our customers’ spending for our services, which could adversely affect our operations. Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns affecting the industries we serve.   Demand for our services by telecommunications customers has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry. Our results for fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 were impacted by customer reductions in near-term spending plans.  Although we experienced an improved operating environment in fiscal 2011, there is no guarantee that future downturns will not occur. During times of economic slowdown, our customers often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. In addition, our underground facility locating services are influenced by the level of overall economic activity. As a result of the foregoing, demand for our services may decline during periods of economic weakness adversely affecting our operations, cash flows and liquidity.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements which may be cancelled by our customers upon notice or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms.   During fiscal 2011, we derived approximately 75.5% of our revenues from master service agreements. By their terms, the majority of these contracts may be cancelled by our customers upon notice, regardless of whether or not we are in default. In addition, our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements. Consequently, projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed with us and the work completed. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of these contracts. As a result, we could be underbid by our competitors or required to lower the price charged under a contract being rebid. The loss of work obtained through master service agreements or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. The industries we serve have experienced and may continue to experience rapid technological, structural and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues.   The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer demands. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability. New, developing, or existing services, such as wireless applications, could displace the wireline systems that we install and that are used by our customers to deliver services to consumers and businesses. In addition, improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability.   Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our current top five customers for fiscal 2011 accounting for approximately 62%, 64% and 64% of our total revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.  If we were to lose one or more of our significant customers, our revenue may significantly decline. In addition, revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period-to-period depending on the timing or volume of work which those customers order or perform with their in-house service organizations. Additionally, the consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer may result in a change in procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity. The loss of work from a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.   9Table of Contents The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive.   We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous small, privately owned companies, as well as several companies that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and, as a result, any organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. Additionally, our competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the services that we provide.  Although our customers currently outsource a significant portion of these services to us and our industry competitors, we can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our financial results are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.   In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements.  These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data.  In some instances, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, purchase price allocations, the fair value of goodwill, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, income taxes, accrued insurance claims, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, and accruals for contingencies, including legal matters. At the time they are made, we believe that such estimates are fair based on the information available.  However, actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements. Our profitability is based on our delivering services within the estimated costs established when pricing our contracts.   We recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units-of-delivery or cost-to-cost measures.  A significant majority of our contracts are based on units-of-delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed. As the price for each of the units is fixed by the contract, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates. Revenues from contracts using the cost-to-cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires that we estimate the costs to be incurred in performing the contract. Our process for estimating costs is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals. Any changes in original cost estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may result in changes to costs and income. These changes would be recognized in the period in which they are determined and could result in significant changes to previously reported profits. We possess a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings assets.   We extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing our customers for that work.  These customers include telephone companies, cable television multiple system operators, and gas and electric utilities and others. At July 30, 2011, we had net accounts receivable of $138.6 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $90.9 million. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments. Slowdowns in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. Furthermore, bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis or at all. The failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability. We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related liabilities, which leaves us exposed to higher than expected claims.   We retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for claims related to automobile liability, general liability, workers’ compensation, employee group health, and locate damages. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims based on facts, circumstances and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors that cannot be known with precision. These factors include the frequency of future claims, the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations. Should a greater number of claims occur compared to what we have estimated, or should the dollar amount of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Accrued Insurance Claims” and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   10Table of Contents Our backlog is subject to reduction and/or cancellation.   Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job-specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other long-term requirements contracts. Many of our contracts are multi-year agreements, and we include in our backlog the services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and, more generally our experience in procurements of this type.  In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services. Our estimates of a customer’s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate.  If our estimated backlog is significantly inaccurate or does not result in future profits, this could adversely affect our future earnings and the price of our common stock. We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets.   We account for goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (“ASC Topic 350”). Our reporting units and related indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value.  In addition, they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value.  If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized.  Any such write-down could adversely affect our results of operations. As a result of our interim impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of $94.4 million.  The fiscal 2009 interim impairment charge included impairments at the following reporting units:  Broadband Installation Services for $14.8 million, C-2 Utility Contractors for $9.2 million, Ervin Cable Construction for $15.7 million, Nichols Construction for $2.0 million, Stevens Communications for $2.4 million, and UtiliQuest for $50.5 million. As the result of our annual impairment test of goodwill in fiscal 2008, we recognized non-cash charges of approximately $5.9 million related to our Stevens Communications reporting unit and approximately $3.8 million related to our Nichols Construction reporting unit. Additionally, in fiscal 2005 and 2006, we recognized non-cash charges of approximately $29.0 million related to our White Mountain Cable Construction reporting unit and $14.8 million related to our Can-Am Communications reporting unit, respectively.  The impairment charges reduced the carrying value of goodwill related to these reporting units. Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units.  The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the level of overall economic activity. Individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole. Specifically, during times of economic slowdown, our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. As a result, demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline which could adversely affect our operations, cash flow, and liquidity, and could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions, including class action lawsuits, that are brought or threatened against us for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (the “FLSA”) and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings.  The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.  In addition, regardless of the outcome, these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of current legal proceedings, see “Legal Proceedings” and Note 18 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our business.   We depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries. Our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry, and the loss of any one of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy.  Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time.  The loss of key management could adversely affect our operations. We do not carry significant “key-person” life insurance on any of our employees.Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.   Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for employees possessing the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees.  In addition, our labor costs may increase when there is a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel.   11Table of Contents We may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations. We utilize independent subcontractors to complete work on a portion of our projects. If we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all, we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase.  In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they performed.  Any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business, and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers.   Fuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. As a result, higher fuel costs may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.  Although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments, underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Delays in the receipt of materials could result in delays in the performance of our services. There is an increased demand for fiber optic cable because our customers are expanding the capacity of their networks. In addition, fiber optic cable suppliers have experienced and could further experience delays in the delivery of materials. While there have not been significant delays to date, future delays could adversely affect the timing of the construction and maintenance services we provide to our customers.Our results of operations fluctuate seasonally.   Our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors. Consequently, our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather. Generally, inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters. Also, a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Additionally, our customer premise equipment installation activities historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period. As a result of these factors, we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal year. We may be unable to generate internal growth.   Our internal growth may be affected by, among other factors, our ability to offer the services our existing customers require, attract new customers, and hire and retain qualified employees or independent subcontractors. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth, such as the capital budgets of our customers and the availability of qualified employees, may be beyond our control. Should one or more of these factors occur, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business. Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations.   As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. We regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including the diversion of management’s attention from our existing business, the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves; and the potential impairment of acquired intangible assets. Our ability to grow and maintain our competitive position may be adversely affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability.   We are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the United States and Canada and certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income to different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or tax laws. An increase to our effective tax rate would reduce our profitability.  In addition, the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.   12Table of Contents Our senior subordinated notes and revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions.   At July 30, 2011, we had $187.5 million in senior subordinated notes (the “Notes”) outstanding due 2021. We also have a revolving credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a maximum borrowing of $225.0 million, including a sublimit of $100.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit.  At July 30, 2011, we had no outstanding borrowings and $39.9 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement. The terms of our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things:  make certain payments, including the payment of dividends; redeem or repurchase our capital stock; incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; make investments or create liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with another entity; sell certain assets; and enter into transactions with affiliates.  In addition, the Credit Agreement requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. A default under our Credit Agreement or the indenture governing the Notes could result in the acceleration of our obligations under either or both of those agreements as a result of cross acceleration and cross default provisions. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.  Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated and new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the profitability of our specialty contracting service.   Many of our telecommunications customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”).  The FCC may alter the application of its current regulations and may impose additional regulations.  If existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our telecommunications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide, our customers may reduce expenditures which could impact the demand for specialty contracting services.Legislative actions and initiatives relating to telecommunications may not result in an increase in demand for our services. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) originally allocated $7.2 billion in funding to accelerate broadband deployment in rural areas of the country that have been without broadband infrastructure.  However, we cannot predict the extent or timing of benefits to us from the deployment of ARRA-funded networks.   We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters.   Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and work near high voltage lines. As a result, they and others are subject to potential injury.  If any of our workers or any other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations, which could result in a fine or, in extreme cases, criminal sanction.  In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award to us future business. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.  A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers. As a result, we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to encountering underground objects which may cause the release of hazardous substances. Additionally, the environmental laws and regulations which relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the discharge of hazardous substances may include clean-up costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations. We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth.   Using cash for operational growth, capital expenditures, share repurchases, or acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt. Also, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility.  If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes in business requirements.   Our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time as a result of changes in our business. Increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations.   13Table of Contents Increases in our health insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. The costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. Additionally, we may incur additional costs as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Laws”) that were signed into law in March 2010.  A continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of the Health Care Reform Laws could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.   During fiscal 2011, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $18.56 per share to a low of $7.45 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to:·  fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;·  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;·  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and·  the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services. In addition, factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control.   Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management.  For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors.  In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine.  The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. Lastly, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act.  These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control"

.     Our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. If any of the risks  described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.     The economic downturn and challenges in the financial and credit markets may adversely impact our customers’ future spending.   The duration of the current economic weakness and the impact that it will have on our customers remain uncertain. The economic slowdown, when combined with developments in the financial and credit markets, has created a challenging business environment for us and our customers.  Slowing economic growth may adversely impact the demand for our services and potentially result in the delay or cancellation of projects by our customers. This makes it difficult to estimate our customers’ requirements for our services and adds uncertainty to the determination of our backlog. Our customers generally finance their projects through cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity. As a result, volatility in the credit and equity markets could reduce the availability of debt or equity financing of our customers.   This may result in a reduction in our customers’ spending for our services, which could have an adverse effect on our operations.     Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to downturns affecting the industries we serve.  Demand for our services by telecommunications customers has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry. In fiscal 2010, our telecommunications customers accounted for over 79.2% of our revenues. Fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2010 results were impacted by customer reductions in near term spending plans and a slow growth environment may continue into fiscal 2011. During times of economic slowdown, our customers often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. Our underground facility locating services are required prior to underground excavation, which is dependent in part on construction activity, and accordingly, are also influenced by the level of overall economic activity. As a result of the foregoing, demand for our services may decline during periods of economic downturns and could adversely affect our operations, cash flows and liquidity.     We derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements which may be cancelled by our customers upon notice or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms.   During fiscal 2010, we derived approximately 76.0% of our revenues from master service agreements. By their terms, the majority of these contracts may be cancelled by our customers upon notice, even if we are not in default, and our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements. Consequently, projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed and completed. During the last several years we have been able to renew or extend some of our master service agreements on negotiated terms rather than through a competitive bidding process. Market conditions could change, however, and our customers could require the renewal of these contracts through competitive bidding. As a result of competitive bidding, we could be underbid by our competitors or required to lower the price charged under the contract being rebid. The loss of work obtained through master service agreements or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.   8Table of Contents       The industries we serve have experienced and may continue to experience rapid technological, structural and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues.   The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer needs. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.

In addition, improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.     We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers could adversely impact our revenues and profitability.   Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers accounting for approximately 64% of our total revenues from continuing operations in each of fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008. Our revenue may significantly decline if we were to lose one or more of our significant customers. In addition, revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period-to-period depending on the timing and volume of work which those customers order or perform with their in-house service organizations. Additionally, consolidations, mergers and acquisitions in the telecommunications industry have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. The consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer may result in a change in procurement strategies by the surviving entity. Reduced demand for our services or a change in procurement strategy of a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.     The specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive.   We compete with other independent contractors, including numerous small, owner-operated private companies, as well as several companies that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate and, as a result, any organization with adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become a competitor. Our competitors may develop the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We may also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the same services that we provide. Although our customers currently outsource a significant portion of these services to us and our industry competitors, we can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future.     Our financial results are based on estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results.   In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available. In some cases, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, the fair value of goodwill, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, income taxes, accrued insurance claims, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, and accruals for contingencies, including legal matters. At the time they are made, we believe that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with the consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial statements.     Our profitability is based on our ability to deliver our services within the estimated costs used to establish the pricing of our contracts.   We recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units-of-delivery or cost-to-cost measures. A significant majority of our contracts are based on units-of-delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed. As the price for each of the units is fixed by the contract, our profitability could decline if our actual costs to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates. Revenues from contracts using the cost-to-cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires that our management estimate the costs to be incurred by us in performing the contract. Our process for estimating costs is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals. However, any changes in original estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects would be recognized in the period in which such revisions are determined. These changes could result in the reduction or elimination of previously reported profits, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.     We possess a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings assets.   We extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing our customers for that work. These customers include telephone companies, cable television multiple system operators, and gas and electric utilities and others. At July 31, 2010, we had net accounts receivable of $110.1 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $66.6 million. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments. Slowdowns in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. Further bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis or at all, reducing our cash flows and adversely impacting our liquidity and profitability. Additionally, we could incur losses in excess of current bad debt allowances. 9Table of Contents     We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related liabilities, which leaves us exposed to higher than expected claims.   We retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for claims related to automobile liability, general liability, workers’ compensation, employee group health, and locate damages. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims based on facts, circumstances and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors that cannot be known with precision. These factors include the frequency of future claims, the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations. Should a greater number of claims occur compared to what we have estimated, or should the dollar amount of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies — Accrued Insurance Claims” and Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K.     Our backlog is subject to reduction and/or cancellation.   Our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job-specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under master service agreements and other long-term requirements contracts. Many of our contracts are multi-year agreements, and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and, more generally our experience in procurements of this type. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract. Our estimates of a customer’s requirements during a particular future period may not prove to be accurate, particularly in light of the current economic conditions and the uncertainty that imposes on changes in our customer’s requirements for our services. If our estimated backlog is significantly inaccurate or does not result in future profits, this could adversely affect our future growth and the price of our common stock.     We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets.   We account for goodwill in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standard Codification (“ASC”) Topic 350, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (“ASC Topic 350”). Our reporting units and related indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized. Any such write-down could adversely affect our results of operations. As a result of our interim impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of $94.4 million. The fiscal 2009 interim impairment charge included impairments at the following reporting units: Broadband Installation Services for $14.8 million, C-2 Utility Contractors for $9.2 million, Ervin Cable Construction for $15.7 million, Nichols Construction for $2.0 million, Stevens Communications for $2.4 million, and UtiliQuest for $50.5 million. As the result of our annual impairment test of goodwill in fiscal 2008, we recognized non-cash charges of approximately $5.9 million related to our Stevens Communications reporting unit and approximately $3.8 million related to our Nichols Construction reporting unit. Additionally, in fiscal 2005 and 2006, we recognized non-cash charges of approximately $29.0 million related to our White Mountain Cable Construction reporting unit and $14.8 million related to our Can-Am Communications, Inc. reporting unit, respectively. The impairment charges reduced the carrying value of goodwill related to these reporting units.     Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors resulting from the cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, the concentration of our revenues within a limited number of customers, and the level of overall economic activity. Individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors than the company as a whole. Specifically, during times of economic slowdown, our customers may reduce their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. As a result, demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units could decline which could adversely affect our operations, cash flow, and liquidity and could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.     We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions, including class action lawsuits, that are brought or threatened against us for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (the “FLSA”) and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation or court judgment could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, regardless of the outcome, these proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of current legal proceedings, see “Legal Proceedings” and Note 18 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K. 10Table of Contents     The loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our business.   We depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries. Our senior management team has many years of experience in our industry, and the loss of any one of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees, we cannot guarantee that any of these or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time. The loss of key management could adversely affect the management of our operations. We do not carry significant “;key-person” life insurance on any of our employees.     Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees.   Our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for employees having the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees. In addition, we cannot be certain that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of shortages in the supply of these skilled personnel. As a result, our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability may be affected if we are unable to hire qualified employees and manage labor costs to retain employees.     We may be unable to secure sufficient subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations. We utilize subcontractors to complete work on a portion of our projects. We may be unable to secure the subcontractors necessary to perform work under a contract, thereby causing delay or increasing the cost of completing the work.  In addition, we may have disputes with these subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor. Any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.     Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business, and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers.   Fuel prices fluctuate based on events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases when renewing or bidding contracts to compensate us for rising costs. As a result, higher fuel costs may negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations. Although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments, underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions, declines in fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.     Our results of operations fluctuate seasonally.   Our revenues are affected by seasonality since a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors. Consequently, our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather. Generally, inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters. Also, a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Additionally, our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period. As a result, we may experience reduced revenue in the second or third quarters of our fiscal years.     We may be unable to generate internal growth.   Our internal growth may be affected by, among other factors, our ability to offer valuable services to existing customers, attract new customers, and hire and retain qualified employees or subcontractors. Many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control, such as the capital budgets of our customers and the availability of qualified employees. Should one or more of these factors occur, we may not be able to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our business.     Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations.   As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. We regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks, including the diversion of management’s attention from our existing business, the failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired business, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired business for which there are inadequate reserves and the potential impairment of acquired intangible assets. Our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to successfully integrate any businesses acquired.     Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability.   We are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the United States and Canada and certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income to different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or tax laws. An increase to our effective tax rate could reduce our profitability. In addition, the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. 11Table of Contents      Our senior subordinated notes and revolving credit facility impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions.   At July 31, 2010, we had $135.35 million in senior subordinated notes (the “Notes”) outstanding due October 2015. The Notes were issued under an indenture dated as of October 11, 2005. The indenture governing the Notes contains covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends; redeem or repurchase our capital stock; incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock; make investments or create liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or consolidate with another entity; sell certain assets; and enter into transactions with affiliates.     On June 4, 2010, we entered into a new five-year revolving credit agreement ( the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit Agreement replaces the Company’s prior credit facility which was due to expire in September 2011. The Credit Agreement has an expiration date of June 4, 2015 and provides for a maximum borrowing of $225.0 million, including a sublimit of $100.0 million for the issuance of letters of credit. The Credit Agreement requires us to: (i) maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 3.00 to 1.00, as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter and (ii) maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.75 to 1.00 for fiscal quarters ending July 31, 2010 through April 28, 2012 and not less than 3.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter ending July 28, 2012 and each fiscal quarter thereafter, as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement also contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations with respect to indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, disposition of assets, sale-leaseback transactions, transactions with affiliates and capital expenditures. A default under our Credit Agreement or the indenture could result in the acceleration of our obligations under either or both of those agreements as a result of cross acceleration and cross default provisions. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.      Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the profitability of our specialty contracting service.   Many of our telecommunications customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”). The FCC may alter the application of its regulations to telecommunication companies from the way such regulations are currently applied and may further impose additional regulations. If existing or new regulations have an adverse affect on our telecommunications customers and adversely impact the profitability of the services they provide, our customers may reduce expenditures for our specialty contracting services.     Legislative actions and initiatives relating to telecommunications may not result in an increase in demand for our services. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) originally allocated $7.2 billion in funding to accelerate broadband deployment in rural areas of the country that have been without high-speed infrastructure. However, we cannot predict the actual benefits to us from the implementation of ARRA programs. For example, significant additional contracts resulting from investments for rural broadband deployment under the ARRA may not be awarded to us.     We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impacts relating to occupational health and safety matters.   Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and work with high voltage lines. As such, they are subject to potential injury to themselves or others in the vicinity of work being performed. If any of our workers or any other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations, which could result in a fine or, in extreme cases, criminal sanction. In addition, if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time, customers could decide to cancel our contracts and or not award us future business.     Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities.   Our operations consist, in part, of work performed underground. As a result, we are potentially subject to material liabilities related to encountering underground objects which may cause the release of hazardous materials or substances. The environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business include those regarding the removal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste. These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the discharge of hazardous materials or substances may include clean-up costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be significant and could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.     In addition, new laws and regulations, changed enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.     We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth.   Using cash for acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt, and if we seek more debt we may be required to agree to additional covenants that limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we seek additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. 12Table of Contents     Our capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes in business requirements.   Our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time as a result of changes in our business requirements. An increase in capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations.     Increases in our health insurance costs could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows. The costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. Additionally, we may incur additional costs as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Care Reform Laws”) that were signed into law in March 2010. A continued rise in health care costs or additional costs as a result of the Health Care Reform Laws could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.     The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.   During fiscal 2009 and 2010, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $18.12 per share to a low of $3.67 per share. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to:●fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one of our competitors;●announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments; ●changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and●the impact of economic weakness on the credit and stock markets and on our customers’ demand for our services.     In addition, factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments.     Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law, provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws and our shareholder rights plan could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control.   Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. We have also adopted a shareholder rights plan, which may make it more difficult to effect a change in control. Lastly, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control, even if such change would be beneficial to stockholders. This could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 13Table of Contents"
15,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2009-09-03,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Our business is subject to a variety of risks and    uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and    uncertainties described below. If any of the following risks    were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations    could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could    decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us,    or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or    become significant, our financial condition and results of    operations could suffer and the trading price of our common    stock could decline. This Annual Report on    Form 10-K    also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations,    projections, intention, or beliefs about future events that are    intended as forward- looking statements under the    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be    read in conjunction with the section entitled Cautionary    Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements, included at    the beginning of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K. The recent economic downturn and the financial and credit    crisis may adversely impact our customers future spending    and their ability to pay amounts owed to    us.  Growth in economic activity slowed    substantially during fiscal 2009. The duration of the economic    weakness and the impact that it will have on our customers    remains uncertain. Slowing economic growth may adversely impact    the demand for our services and potentially result in the delay    or cancellation of projects by our customers. This makes it    difficult to estimate our customers requirements for our    services and adds uncertainty to the determination of our    backlog. Our customers generally finance their projects through    cash flow from operations, the incurrence of debt or the    issuance of equity. Recently, there has been significant    volatility in the credit markets and a reduction in the general    availability of credit. Additionally, many of our    customers equity values have substantially declined. A    reduction in cash flow and the lack of availability of debt or    equity financing may result in a reduction in our    customers spending for our services and may also impact    the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us, which    could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our    ability to grow at historical levels. Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to    downturns affecting the industries we    serve.  Demand for our services by    telecommunications customers has been, and will likely continue    to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the    telecommunications industry. In fiscal 2009, our    telecommunications customers accounted for over 77.7% of our    revenues from continuing operations. Beginning with the second    quarter of fiscal 2009, our results were impacted by customer    reductions in near term spending plans and we believe a slow    growth environment will continue into fiscal 2010. During times    of economic slowdown, our customers often reduce their capital    expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. Our    underground facility locating services are required prior to    underground excavation, which is dependent in part on    construction activity, and accordingly, are also influenced by    the level of overall economic activity. As a result of the    foregoing, demand for our services may decline during periods of    economic downturns and could adversely affect our operations,    cash flows and liquidity.    7Table of ContentsWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from master    service agreements which may be cancelled by our customers upon    notice or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated    terms.  During fiscal 2009, we derived    approximately 69.5% of our revenues from master service    agreements. By their terms, the majority of these contracts may    be cancelled by our customers upon notice, even if we are not in    default, and our customers generally have no obligation to    assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements.    Consequently, projected expenditures by customers are not    assured until a definitive work order is placed and completed.    During the last several years we have been able to renew or    extend some of our master service agreements on negotiated terms    rather than through a competitive bidding process. Market    conditions could change, however, and our customers could    require the renewal of these contracts through competitive    bidding. As a result of competitive bidding, we could be    underbid by our competitors or required to lower the price    charged under the contract being rebid. The loss of work    obtained through master service agreements or the reduced    profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of    operations, cash flows and liquidity. The industries we serve have experienced and may continue to    experience rapid technological, structural and competitive    changes that could reduce the need for our services and    adversely affect our revenues.  The    telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid    technological change, intense competition and changing consumer    needs. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from    customers in the telecommunications industry. New technologies,    or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce    the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and    profitability. New, developing, or existing services, such as    wireless applications, could displace the wireline systems we    install and that are used by our customers to deliver services    to consumers. In addition, improvements in existing technology    may allow telecommunication companies to improve their networks    without physically upgrading them. Reduced demand for our    services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely    affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a    limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of    these customers could adversely impact our revenues and    profitability.  Our customer base is highly    concentrated, with our top five customers in fiscal years 2009,    2008, and 2007 accounting for approximately 64%, 64%, and 63%,    respectively, of our total revenues from continuing operations.    Our revenue may significantly decline if we were to lose one or    more of our significant customers. In addition, revenues under    our contracts with significant customers may vary from    period-to-period    depending on the timing and volume of work which those customers    order or perform with their in-house service organizations.    Additionally, consolidations, mergers and acquisitions in the    telecommunications industry have occurred in the past and may    occur in the future. The consolidation, merger or acquisition of    an existing customer may result in a change in procurement    strategies by the surviving entity. Reduced demand for our    services or a change in procurement strategy of a significant    customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash    flows and liquidity. The specialty contracting services industry in which we    operate is highly competitive.  We compete with    other independent contractors, including numerous small,    owner-operated private companies, as well as several companies    that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that    exceed our own. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the    markets in which we operate and, as a result, any organization    with adequate financial resources and access to technical    expertise may become a competitor. Our competitors may develop    the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that    are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services,    and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive    position. We may also face competition from the in-house service    organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of    the same services that we provide. Although our customers    currently outsource a significant portion of these services to    us and our industry competitors, we can offer no assurance that    our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource    specialty contracting services in the future. Our financial results are based on estimates and assumptions    that may differ from actual results.  In preparing    our consolidated financial statements in conformity with    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, a    number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These    estimates and assumptions must be made because certain    information that is used in the preparation of our financial    statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be    calculated with a high degree of precision from data available.    In some cases, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we    must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used    in our assessment of the recognition of revenue for costs    8Table of Contents    and estimated earnings in excess of billings, the fair value of    goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, accrued insurance    claims, asset lives used in computing depreciation and    amortization, allowance for doubtful accounts, compensation    expense for performance-based stock awards, and the outcome of    contingencies, including legal matters. At the time they are    made, we believe that such estimates are fair when considered in    conjunction with the consolidated financial position and results    of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could    differ from those estimates and such differences may be material    to the financial statements and could adversely affect our    results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Our profitability is based on our ability to deliver our    services within the estimated costs used to establish the    pricing of our contracts.  We recognize revenues    under the percentage of completion method of accounting using    the units of delivery or    cost-to-cost    measures. A significant majority of our contracts are based on    units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is    completed. As the price for each of the units is fixed by the    contract, our profitability could decline if our actual costs to    complete each unit exceeds our original estimates. Revenues from    contracts using the    cost-to-cost    measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of    contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract    costs. Application of the percentage of completion method of    accounting requires that our management estimate the costs to be    incurred by us in performing the contract. Our process for    estimating costs is based upon the professional knowledge and    experience of our project managers and financial professionals.    However, any changes in original estimates, or the assumptions    underpinning such estimates, may result in revisions to costs    and income and their effects would be recognized in the period    in which such revisions are determined. These changes could    result in the reduction or elimination of previously reported    profits, which could adversely affect our profitability and the    price of our common stock. We possess a significant amount of accounts receivable and    costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings    assets.  We extend credit to our customers as a    result of performing work under contract prior to billing our    customers for that work. These customers include telephone    companies, cable television multiple system operators, and gas    and electric utilities and others. At July 25, 2009, we had    net accounts receivable of $117.0 million and costs and    estimated earnings in excess of billings of $67.1 million.    We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and    continuously monitor the timeliness of payments. Slowdowns in    the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of    one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us    on a timely basis or at all. During fiscal 2009, one of our    significant customers proposed a financial restructuring    effected through a Chapter 11 filing. As part of its    financial restructuring, this customer has received    authorization from the United States Bankruptcy Court for the    Southern District of New York to continue to pay its trade    creditors in full, including us. Further bankruptcies or    financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector    could hinder the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely    basis or at all, reducing our cash flows and adversely impacting    our liquidity and profitability. Additionally, we could incur    losses in excess of current bad debt allowances. We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related    liabilities, which leaves us exposed to higher than expected    claims.  We retain the risk of loss, up to certain    limits, for claims related to automobile liability, general    liability, workers compensation, employee group health,    and locate damages. We estimate and develop our accrual for    these claims based on facts, circumstances and historical    evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims    remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors    that cannot be known with precision. These factors include the    frequency of future claims, the payment pattern of claims which    have been incurred, changes in the medical condition of    claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or    other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court    interpretations. Should a greater number of claims occur    compared to what we have estimated, or should the dollar amount    of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded    reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial    additional unanticipated charges. See Managements    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of    Operations  Critical Accounting Policies     Accrued Insurance Claims and Note 8 to the    consolidated financial statements in this    Form 10-K. Our backlog is subject to reduction    and/or    cancellation.  Our backlog consists of the    uncompleted portion of services to be performed under    job-specific contracts and the estimated value of future    services that we expect to provide under  master service    agreements and other long-term requirements contracts. Many of    our contracts are multi-year agreements, and we include in our    backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over    the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience    with customers and, more generally our experience in    procurements of this type. In many instances, our customers are    not contractually committed to procure specific    9Table of Contents    volumes of services under a contract. Our estimates of a    customers requirements during a particular future period    may not prove to be accurate, particularly in light of the    current economic conditions and the uncertainty that imposes on    changes in our customers requirements for our services. If    our estimated backlog is significantly inaccurate or does not    result in future profits, this could adversely affect our future    growth and the price of our common stock. We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other    intangible assets.  We account for goodwill in    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards    (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other    Intangible Assets. Our reporting units and related    indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually during    the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine    whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In    addition, they are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs    or circumstances change between annual tests that would more    likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value. If    we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other    indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying    value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized    in an amount equal to the difference. Any such write-down could    adversely affect our results of operations. As a result of our    interim impairment analysis during the second quarter of fiscal    2009, we recognized a non-cash charge of $94.4 million. The    fiscal 2009 interim impairment charge included impairments at    the following reporting units: Broadband Installation Services    for $14.8 million, C-2 Utility Contractors for    $9.2 million, Ervin Cable Construction for    $15.7 million, Nichols Construction for $2.0 million,    Stevens Communications for $2.4 million, and UtiliQuest for    $50.5 million. As the result of our annual impairment test    of goodwill in fiscal 2008, we recognized non-cash charges of    approximately $5.9 million related to our Stevens    Communications reporting unit and approximately    $3.8 million related to our Nichols Construction reporting    unit. Additionally, in fiscal 2005 and 2006, we recognized    non-cash charges of approximately $29.0 million related to    our White Mountain Cable Construction reporting unit and    $14.8 million related to our    Can-Am    Communications, Inc. reporting unit, respectively. The    impairment charges reduced the carrying value of goodwill    related to these reporting units.     Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The    profitability of individual reporting units may suffer    periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors    resulting from the cyclical nature of our business, the high    level of competition existing within our industry, the    concentration of our revenues within a limited number of    customers, and the level of overall economic activity.    Individual reporting units may be relatively more impacted by    these factors than the Company as a whole. Specifically, during    times of economic slowdown, our customers may reduce their    capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. As a    result, demand for the services of one or more of the reporting    units could decline which could adversely affect our operations,    cash flow, and liquidity and could result in an impairment of    goodwill or intangible assets. We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory    proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage    and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our    business and financial performance. From time to time, we    may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions, including    class action lawsuits, that are brought or threatened against us    for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (the    FLSA) and state wage and hour laws. Due to the    inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately    predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. The    ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement,    mediation or court judgment could have a material adverse impact    on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash    flows. In addition, regardless of the outcome, these proceedings    could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote    substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of    current legal proceedings, see Legal Proceedings and    Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in this    Form 10-K. The loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our    business.  We depend on the services of our    executive officers and the senior management of our    subsidiaries. Our senior management team has many years of    experience in our industry, and the loss of any one of them    could negatively affect our ability to execute our business    strategy. Although we have entered into employment agreements    with our executive officers and certain other key employees, we    cannot guarantee that any key management personnel will remain    employed by us for any length of time. The loss of key    management could adversely affect the management of our    operations. We do not carry significant key-person    life insurance on any of our employees.    10Table of ContentsOur business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to    attract and retain qualified employees.  Our    ability to maintain our productivity and profitability is    limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the skilled    personnel necessary to operate our business. We cannot be    certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force    necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth    strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors    such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for    employees having the skills we need and the level of    compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees. In    addition, we cannot be certain that our labor expenses will not    increase as a result of shortages in the supply of these skilled    personnel. As a result, our ability to maintain our productivity    and profitability may be affected if we are unable to hire    qualified employees and manage labor costs to retain employees. Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business,    and we may not be able to pass along added costs to    customers.  Fuel prices fluctuate based on events    outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to    adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term    and we may be unable to secure price increases when renewing or    bidding contracts to compensate us for rising costs. As a    result, higher fuel costs may negatively impact our financial    condition and results of operations. Although we may hedge our    anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial    instruments, underlying commodity costs have been volatile in    recent periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, at    any given time, we will have financial instruments in place to    hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs. To the extent    the Company enters into hedge transactions, declines in fuel    prices below the levels established in the financial instruments    may require us to make payments which could have an adverse    impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our results of operations fluctuate    seasonally.  Our revenues are affected by    seasonality since a significant portion of the work we perform    is outdoors. Consequently, our operations are impacted by    extended periods of inclement weather. Generally, inclement    weather is more likely to occur during the winter season, which    falls during our second and third fiscal quarters. Also, a    disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within    our second quarter, which decreases the number of available    workdays. Additionally, our customer premise equipment    installation activities for cable providers historically    decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers    generally require less activity during this period. As a result    of these factors we may experience reduced revenues in the    second and third fiscal quarters of each year. We may be unable to generate internal    growth.  Our internal growth may be affected by,    among other factors, our ability to offer valuable services to    existing customers, attract new customers, and hire and retain    qualified employees or subcontractors. Many of the factors    affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond    our control, such as the capital budgets of our customers and    the availability of qualified employees. Should one or more of    these factors occur, we may not be able to achieve internal    growth, expand our operations or grow our business. Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could    adversely affect our business and results of    operations.  As part of our growth strategy, we    may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our    business. We regularly review various opportunities and    periodically engage in discussions regarding possible    acquisitions. Future acquisitions may expose us to operational    challenges and risks, including the diversion of    managements attention from our existing business, the    failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired    business, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired    business for which there are inadequate reserves and the    potential impairment of acquired intangible assets. Our ability    to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may    be affected by our ability to successfully integrate any    businesses acquired. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to    additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our    profitability.  We are subject to income taxes in    many different jurisdictions of the United States and Canada and    certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment    of income to different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates    could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in    locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred    tax assets and liabilities, or tax laws. An increase to our    effective tax rate could reduce our profitability. In addition,    the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to    ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material    assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our    profitability. Our senior subordinated notes and revolving credit facility    impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in    beneficial transactions.  At July 25, 2009,    we had $135.35 million in senior subordinated notes    11Table of Contents    outstanding due October 2015. The notes were issued under an    indenture dated as of October 11, 2005. The indenture    governing the notes contains covenants that restrict our ability    to: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends;    redeem or repurchase capital stock; incur additional    indebtedness and issue preferred stock; make investments or    create liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge    or consolidate with another entity; sell certain assets; and    enter into transactions with affiliates.     On September 12, 2008, we entered into a new three-year    revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks. The credit    agreement, as amended in the third quarter of fiscal 2009, has    an expiration date of September 12, 2011 and a maximum    borrowing amount of $210.0 million with the ability to    extend the term for up to two years and borrow up to an    additional $85.0 million. The credit agreement requires us    to: (i) maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not    greater than 3.00 to 1.00 as measured at the end of each fiscal    quarter; (ii) maintain an interest coverage ratio of not    less than 2.75 to 1.00, as measured at the end of each fiscal    quarter; and (iii) maintain consolidated tangible net worth    as calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter, of not less    than $50 million plus 50% of consolidated net income (if    positive) from September 12, 2008 to the date of    computation plus 75% of the equity issuances made from    September 12, 2008 to the date of computation. A default    under our credit agreement or the indenture could result in the    acceleration of our obligations under either or both of those    agreements as a result of cross acceleration and cross default    provisions. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from    engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding    to changing business and economic conditions or securing    additional financing, if needed. Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated    and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing    regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the    profitability of our specialty contracting    service.  Many of our telecommunications customers    are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission    (FCC). The FCC may alter the application of its    regulations to telecommunication companies from the way such    regulations are currently applied and may further impose    additional regulations. If existing or new regulations have an    adverse affect on our telecommunications customers and adversely    impact the profitability of the services they provide, our    customers may reduce expenditures for our specialty contracting    services. We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impacts    relating to occupational health and safety    matters.  Our operations are subject to stringent    laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers    frequently operate heavy machinery and work with high voltage    lines. As such, they are subject to potential injury to    themselves or others in the vicinity of work being performed. If    any of our workers or any other persons are injured or killed in    the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated    relevant safety regulations, which could result in a fine or, in    extreme cases, criminal sanction. In addition, if our safety    record were to substantially deteriorate over time, customers    could decide to cancel our contracts and or not award us future    business. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in    significant liabilities.  Our operations consist,    in part, of work performed underground. As a result, we are    potentially subject to material liabilities related to    encountering underground objects which may cause the release of    hazardous materials or substances. The environmental laws and    regulations that relate to our business include those regarding    the removal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste.    These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and    criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the    discharge of hazardous materials or substances may include    clean-up    costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be    significant and could adversely affect our results of operations    and cash flows.     In addition, new laws and regulations, changed enforcement of    existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously    unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new    clean-up    requirements could require us to incur significant costs or    become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could    harm our financial condition and results of operations. We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to    finance desired growth.  Using cash for    acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us    more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or    equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain    significant restrictions on our operational and financial    flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt, and    if we seek more debt we may be required to agree to additional    covenants that limit our operational and financial flexibility.    If we seek additional debt or equity    12Table of Contents    financings, we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity    will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes    in business requirements.  Our anticipated capital    expenditure requirements may vary from time to time as a result    of changes in our business requirements. An increase in capital    expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing    costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from    operations. The market price of our common stock has been, and may    continue to be, highly volatile.  During fiscal    2008 and 2009, our common stock fluctuated from a high of $32.36    per share to a low of $3.67 per share. We may continue to    experience significant volatility in the market price of our    common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited    to:           fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results    of one of our competitors;           announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts,    acquisitions or capital commitments;           changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities    analysts; and           the impact of continuing economic weakness on the credit and    stock markets and on our customers demand for our services.     In addition, factors unrelated to our operating performance,    such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic    conditions, and political events, could decrease the market    price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose    some or all of their investments. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law, provisions in our    articles of incorporation and by-laws and our shareholder rights    plan could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of    our company or a change in our control.  Certain    provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could    delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the    replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For    example, our board of directors is divided into three classes.    At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only    have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the    directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles    of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without    further shareholder approval, to issue up to    1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with    such rights as our board of directors may determine. The    issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the    holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting    control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of    stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. We have    also adopted a shareholder rights plan, which may make it more    difficult to effect a change in control. Lastly, we are subject    to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business    Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage    or prevent a change in control, even if such change would be    beneficial to stockholders. This could adversely affect the    market price of our common stock. "
1,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2008-09-04,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Our business is subject to a variety of risks and    uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and    uncertainties described below. If any of the following risks    were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations    could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could    decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us,    or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or    become significant, our financial condition and results of    operations could suffer and the trading price of our common    stock could decline. This Annual Report on    Form 10-K    also includes statements reflecting assumptions, expectations,    projections, intention, or beliefs about future events that are    intended as forward looking statements under the    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be    read in conjunction with the section entitled Cautionary    Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements, included at    the beginning of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K. Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to    downturns affecting the industries we    serve.  Demand for our services by    telecommunications customers has been, and will likely continue    to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the    telecommunications industry. In fiscal 2008, our    telecommunications customers accounted for over 75% of our    revenues from continuing operations. During the second quarter    of fiscal 2008, our results were impacted by a decline in    customer spending which occurred in January. This decline was    the result of a noticeable softening in the intensity with which    a broad range of customers executed near-term spending plans. It    was evident in the delayed approval of calendar 2008 budgets by    certain customers, the pace with which approved budgets were    executed during January, overall volumes of available work, and    in certain instances, customer-specific delays. Due to the pace    of Januarys revenue decline in relation to our scheduled    workforce level, gross margin was negatively affected. These    conditions generally improved during the second half of fiscal    2008. However, we believe a slow growth environment will    continue into fiscal 2009. Additionally, bankruptcies or    financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector    could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity    and profitability.     During times of economic slowdown, our customers often reduce    their capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects.    Such developments occur even among customers that are not    experiencing financial difficulties. Our underground facility    locating services are required prior to underground excavation,    which is dependent in part on construction activity, and    accordingly, is influenced by the level of overall economic    activity. As a result of the foregoing, demand for our services    may decline during periods of economic downturns and adversely    affect our operations, cash flows and liquidity. Additionally,    future slowdowns in the industries we serve may impair the    financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder    their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from master    service agreements which may be cancelled by our customers upon    notice.  During fiscal 2008, we derived    approximately 70.3% of our revenues from master service    agreements. By their terms, the majority of these contracts may    be cancelled by our customers upon notice, even if we are not in    default. In addition, our customers generally have no obligation    to assign a specific amount of work to us under these    agreements. Consequently, projected expenditures by customers    are not assured until such time as a definitive work order is    placed and completed. The loss of work obtained through master    service agreements could adversely affect our results of    operations, cash flows and liquidity. We may be unable to renew master service agreements on    negotiated terms in the future.  During the last    several years we have been able to renew or extend some of our    master service agreements on negotiated terms rather than    through a competitive bidding process. Market conditions could    change, resulting in our customers requiring the renewal of    these contracts through competitive bidding. As a result of    competitive bidding, we could be underbid by our competitors or    required to lower the price charged under the contract being    rebid. The loss of work obtained through master service    agreements or the reduced profitability of such work could    adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and    liquidity. The industries we serve have experienced and may continue to    experience rapid technological, structural and competitive    changes that could reduce the need for our services and    adversely affect our revenues.  The    telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid    technological change, intense competition and changing    7Table of Contents    consumer needs. We generate a significant portion of our    revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. New    technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers,    could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our    revenues and profitability. New, developing, or existing    services, such as wireless applications, could displace the    wireline systems we install and that are used by our customers    to deliver services to consumers. In addition, improvements in    existing technology may allow telecommunication companies to    improve their networks without physically upgrading them.    Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant    customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash    flows and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a    limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of    these customers could adversely impact our revenues and    profitability.  Our customer base is highly    concentrated, with our top five customers in fiscal years 2008,    2007, and 2006 accounting for approximately 64%, 63%, and 64% of    our total revenues from continuing operations, respectively. Our    revenue may significantly decline if we were to lose one or more    of our significant customers. In addition, revenues under our    contracts with significant customers may vary from    period-to-period depending on the timing and volume of work    which those customers order, or perform with their in-house    service organizations. Additionally, consolidations, mergers and    acquisitions in the telecommunications industry have occurred in    the past and may occur in the future. The consolidation, merger    or acquisition of an existing customer may result in a change in    procurement strategies by the surviving entity. Reduced demand    for our services or a change in procurement strategy of a    significant customer could adversely affect our results of    operations, cash flows and liquidity. The specialty contracting services industry in which we    operate is highly competitive.  We compete with    other independent contractors, including numerous small,    owner-operated private companies, as well as several companies    that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that    exceed our own. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the    markets in which we operate and, as a result, any organization    with adequate financial resources and access to technical    expertise may become a competitor. Our competitors may develop    the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that    are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services,    and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive    position. We may also face competition from the in-house service    organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of    the same types of services we provide. Although our customers    currently outsource a significant portion of these services to    us and our industry competitors, we can offer no assurance that    our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource    specialty contracting services in the future. Our financial results are based on estimates and assumptions    that may differ from actual results.  In preparing    our consolidated financial statements in conformity with    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, a    number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that    affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These    estimates and assumptions must be made because certain    information that is used in the preparation of our financial    statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be    calculated with a high degree of precision from data available.    In some cases, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we    must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used    in our assessment of the revenue recognition for costs and    estimated earnings in excess of billings, allowance for doubtful    accounts, accrued insurance claims, valuation of goodwill and    intangible assets, asset lives used in computing depreciation    and amortization, including amortization of intangibles, and    accounting for performance-based stock awards, income taxes and    contingencies, including legal matters. Actual results could    differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we    use, which may result in a material adverse effect on our    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our profitability is based on our ability to deliver our    services within the estimated costs used to establish the    pricing of our contracts.  We recognize revenues    under the percentage of completion method of accounting using    the units of delivery or cost-to cost measures. A significant    majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and    revenue is recognized as each unit is completed. As the price    for each of the units is fixed by the contract, our    profitability could decline if our actual costs to complete each    unit exceeds our original estimates. Revenues from contracts    using the cost-to-cost measures of completion are recognized    based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total    estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of    completion method of accounting requires that our management    estimate the costs to be incurred by us in performing the    contract. Our process for estimating costs is based upon the    professional knowledge and experience of our project managers    and financial professionals. However, any changes in original    estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may    result in    8Table of Contents    revisions to costs and income and their effects would be    recognized in the period in which such revisions are determined.    These changes could result in the reduction or elimination of    previously reported profits, which could adversely affect our    profitability and the price of our common stock. We possess a significant amount of accounts receivable and    costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings    assets.  We extend credit to our customers as a    result of performing work under contract prior to billing our    customers for that work. These customers include telephone    companies, cable television multiple system operators, and gas    and electric utilities and others. At July 26, 2008, we had    net accounts receivable of $146.4 million and costs and    estimated earnings in excess of billings of $94.3 million.    We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and    continuously monitor the timeliness of payments. If any of our    significant customers were to experience financial difficulties    or file for bankruptcy, we could experience difficulty in    collecting what we are owed for work already performed or in    process, leading to reduced cash flows and a decline in our    liquidity. Additionally, we could incur losses in excess of    current bad debt allowances. We retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related    liabilities, which leaves us exposed to higher than expected    claims.  We retain the risk of loss, up to certain    limits, for claims related to automobile liability, general    liability, workers compensation, employee group health,    and locate damages. We estimate and develop our accrual for    these claims based on facts, circumstances and historical    evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims    remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors    that cannot be known with precision. These factors include the    frequency of future claims, the payment pattern of claims which    have been incurred, changes in the medical condition of    claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or    other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court    interpretations. Should a greater number of claims occur    compared to what we have estimated, or should the dollar amount    of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded    reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial    additional unanticipated charges. See Managements    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of    Operations  Critical Accounting Policies     Accrued Insurance Claims and Note 9 to the    consolidated financial statements in this    Form 10-K. Our backlog is subject to reduction    and/or    cancellation.  Our backlog consists of the    uncompleted portion of services to be performed under    job-specific contracts and the estimated value of future    services that we expect to provide under long-term requirements    contracts, including master service agreements. Many of our    contracts are multi-year agreements, and we include in our    backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over    the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience    with customers and, more generally, our experience in    procurements of this type. In many instances, our customers are    not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of    services under a contract and may terminate a contract for    convenience. Our estimates of a customers requirements    during a particular future period may not be accurate at any    point in time. If our estimated backlog is significantly    inaccurate or does not result in future profits, this could    adversely affect our future growth and the price of our common    stock. We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other    intangible assets.  We account for goodwill in    accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards    (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other    Intangible Assets. Our reporting units and related    indefinite-lived intangible asset are tested annually during the    fourth fiscal quarter of each year in accordance with    SFAS No. 142 in order to determine whether their    carrying value exceeds their fair market value. Should this be    the case, the value of the reporting units goodwill or    indefinite-lived intangible may be impaired and written down.    Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested    for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or    circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely    than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value. If we    determine the fair value of the goodwill or other identifiable    intangible asset is less than their carrying value, an    impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the    difference. Any such write-down could adversely affect our    results of operations. As the result of our annual impairment    test of goodwill in fiscal 2008, we recognized non-cash charges    of approximately $5.9 million related to our Stevens    Communications reporting unit and approximately    $3.8 million related to our Nichols Construction reporting    unit. Additionally, in fiscal 2005 and 2006, we recognized    non-cash charges of approximately $29 million related to    our White Mountain Cable Construction reporting unit and    $14.8 million related to our    Can-Am    Communications, Inc. reporting unit, respectively. The    impairment charges reduced the carrying value of goodwill    related to these reporting units.    9Table of Contents    Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. The    profitability of individual reporting units may suffer    periodically from downturns in customer demand and other factors    which reflect the cyclical nature of our business, the high    level of competition existing within our industry, the    concentration of our revenues within a limited number of    customers and the level of overall economic activity. Individual    reporting units may be relatively more impacted by these factors    than the Company as a whole. Specifically, during times of    economic slowdown, our customers may reduce their capital    expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. As a result,    demand for the services of one or more of the reporting units    could decline during periods of economic downturns which could    adversely affect our operations, cash flows and liquidity. We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory    proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage    and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our    business and financial performance. From time to time, we    may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions, including    class action lawsuits, that are brought or threatened against us    for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (the    FLSA) and state wage and hour laws. Due to the    inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately    predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. The    ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement,    mediation or court judgment could have a material adverse impact    on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash    flows. In addition, regardless of the outcome, these proceedings    could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote    substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of    current legal proceedings, see Legal Proceedings and    Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in this    Form 10-K. The loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our    business.  We depend on the services of our    executive officers and the senior management of our    subsidiaries. Our senior management team has many years of    experience in our industry, and the loss of any one of them    could negatively affect our ability to execute our business    strategy. Although we have entered into employment agreements    with our executive officers and certain other key employees, we    cannot guarantee that any key management personnel will remain    employed by us for any length of time. The loss of key    management could adversely affect the management of our    operations. We do not carry significant key-person    life insurance on any of our employees. Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to    attract and retain qualified employees.  Our    ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be    limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the skilled    personnel necessary to operate our business. We cannot be    certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force    necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth    strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors    such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for    employees having the skills we need and the level of    compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees. In    addition, we cannot be certain that our labor expenses will not    increase as a result of shortages in the supply of these skilled    personnel. As a result, our ability to maintain our productivity    and profitability may be affected if we are unable to hire    qualified employees and manage labor costs to retain employees. Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business,    and we may not be able to pass along added costs to    customers.  Fuel prices fluctuate based on events    outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to    adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during the contract    term. In addition, we may be unable to secure price increases    when renewing or bidding contracts to compensate us for rising    costs. As a result, higher fuel costs may negatively impact our    financial condition and results of operations. Our results of operations fluctuate    seasonally.  Our revenues are affected by    seasonality since a significant portion of the work we perform    is outdoors. Consequently, our operations are impacted by    extended periods of inclement weather. Generally, inclement    weather is more likely to occur during the winter season, which    falls during our second and third fiscal quarters. Also, a    disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within    our second quarter, which decreases the number of available    workdays. Additionally, our customer premise equipment    installation activities for cable providers historically    decrease around calendar year end holidays as their customers    generally require less activity during this period. As a result    of these factors we may experience reduced revenues in the    second and third fiscal quarters of each year. We may be unable to generate internal    growth.  Our internal growth may be affected by,    among other factors, our ability to offer valuable services to    existing customers, attract new customers, and hire and retain    qualified employees or subcontractors. Many of the factors    affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond    10Table of Contents    our control, such as the capital budgets of our customers and    the availability of qualified employees. We may not be able to    achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our    business. Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could    adversely affect our business and results of    operations.  As part of our growth strategy, we    may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our    business. We regularly review various opportunities and    periodically engage in discussions regarding possible    acquisitions. Future acquisitions may expose us to operational    challenges and risks, including the diversion of    managements attention from our existing business, the    failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired    business, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired    business for which there are inadequate reserves and the    potential impairment of acquired intangible assets. Our ability    to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may    be affected by our ability to successfully integrate any    businesses acquired. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to    additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our    profitability.  We are subject to income taxes in    many different jurisdictions of the United States and Canada and    certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment    of income to different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates    could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in    locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred    tax assets and liabilities, or tax laws. In particular, the    carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our    ability to generate future taxable income. An increase to our    effective tax rate could reduce our profitability. In addition,    the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to    ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material    assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our    profitability. Our senior subordinated notes and revolving credit facility    impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in    transactions of benefit.  At July 26, 2008,    we had $150 million in senior subordinated notes    outstanding due October 2015. The notes were issued under an    indenture dated as of October 11, 2005. The indenture    governing the notes contains covenants that restrict our ability    to: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends;    redeem or repurchase capital stock; incur additional    indebtedness and issue preferred stock; make investments; create    liens; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; merge or    consolidate with another entity; sell assets; and enter into    transactions with affiliates. In addition, our credit agreement    requires us to: (i) maintain a consolidated leverage ratio    of not greater than 3.00 to 1.0 as measured at the end of each    fiscal quarter; (ii) maintain an interest coverage ratio of    not less than 2.75 to 1.00, as measured at the end of each    fiscal quarter; and (iii) maintain consolidated tangible    net worth as calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter, of    not less than $50 million plus 50% of consolidated net    income (if positive) from September 8, 2005 to the date of    computation plus 75% of the equity issuances made from    September 8, 2005 to the date of computation (other than    equity issuances made after November 16, 2007 pursuant to    employee stock option programs in an amount not to exceed    $20 million during the term of the credit agreement). A    default under our credit agreement or the indenture could result    in the acceleration of our obligations under either or both of    those agreements as a result of cross acceleration and cross    default provisions. In addition, these covenants may prevent us    from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including    responding to changing business and economic conditions or    securing additional financing, if needed. Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated    and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing    regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty    contracting services and the profitability of those    services.  Many of our telecommunications    customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission    (FCC). The FCC may alter the application of its    regulations to telecommunication companies from the way such    regulations are currently applied and may further impose    additional regulations. If existing or new regulations have an    adverse affect on our telecommunications customers and adversely    impact the profitability of the services they provide, our    customers may reduce expenditures for the specialty contracting    services we provide. We may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impacts    relating to occupational health and safety    matters.  Our operations are subject to stringent    laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers    frequently operate heavy machinery and work with high voltage    lines. As such, they are subject to potential injury to    themselves or others in the vicinity of work being performed. If    any of our workers or any other persons are injured or killed in    the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated    relevant safety regulations, which could result in a fine or, in    extreme cases, criminal sanction. In addition, if our safety    record were to substantially deteriorate over time, customers    could decide to cancel our contracts and or not award us future    business.    11Table of ContentsOur failure to comply with environmental laws could result in    significant liabilities.  Our operations consist,    in part, of work performed underground. As a result, we are    potentially subject to material liabilities related to    encountering underground objects which may cause the release of    hazardous materials or substances. The environmental laws and    regulations that relate to our business include those regarding    the removal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste.    These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and    criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the    discharge of hazardous materials or substances may include    clean-up    costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be    significant and could adversely affect our results of operations    and cash flows.     In addition, new laws and regulations, changed enforcement of    existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously    unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new    clean-up    requirements could require us to incur significant costs or    become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could    harm our financial condition and results of operations. We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to    finance desired growth.  Using cash for    acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us    more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or    equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain    significant restrictions on our operational and financial    flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt, and    if we seek more debt we may be required to agree to additional    covenants that limit our operational and financial flexibility.    If we seek additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be    certain that additional debt or equity will be available to us    on terms acceptable to us or at all. Our capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes    in business requirements.  Our anticipated capital    expenditure requirements may vary from time to time as a result    of changes in our business requirements. An increase in capital    expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing    costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from    operations. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law, provisions in our    articles of incorporation and bylaws and our shareholder rights    plan could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of    our company or a change in our control.  Certain    provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could    delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the    replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For    example, our board of directors is divided into three classes.    At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only    have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the    directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles    of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without    further shareholder approval, to issue up to    1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with    such rights as our board of directors may determine. The    issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the    holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting    control to others. Our bylaws also restrict the right of    stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. We have    also adopted a shareholder rights plan, which may make it more    difficult to effect a change in control. Lastly, we are subject    to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business    Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage    or prevent a change in control, even if such change would be    beneficial to stockholders. This could adversely affect the    market price of our common stock. "
10,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2007-09-07,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors Our business is subject to a variety of risks and    uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and    uncertainties described below. If any of the following risks    were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations    could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could    decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us,    or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or    become significant, our financial condition and results of    operations could suffer and the trading price of our common    stock could decline. This Annual Report on    Form 10-K    also includes statement reflecting assumptions, expectations,    projections, intention, or beliefs about future events that are    intended as forward looking statements under the    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and should be    read in conjunction with the section entitled Cautionary    Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements, included at    the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Demand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to    downturns affecting the industries we    serve.  Demand for  our services by    telecommunications customers has been, and will likely continue    to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the    telecommunications industry. In fiscal 2007, our    telecommunications customers accounted for 74.7% of our revenues    from continuing operations. In fiscal 2002 and the first half of    fiscal 2003, certain portions of the telecommunications industry    suffered a severe downturn that resulted in a number of our    customers experiencing financial difficulties. Several of our    customers filed for bankruptcy protection, including Adelphia    Communications Corporation (Adelphia) and WorldCom,    Inc. (WorldCom). Additional bankruptcies or    financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector    could reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity    and profitability. During times of economic slowdown, our    customers often reduce their capital expenditures and defer or    cancel pending projects. Such developments have occured even    among customers that are not experiencing financial    difficulties. Additionally, our utility locating services are    provided to a variety of utility companies, including    telecommunication providers. These services are required prior    to underground excavation, which is dependent in part on    construction activity, which is influenced by the level of    overall economic growth. As a result of the foregoing, demand    for our services could decline during periods of economic    downturns which could    7Table of Contents    adversely affect our operations, cash flows and liquidity.    Additionally, future slowdowns in the industries we serve may    impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers,    thereby hindering their ability to pay us on a timely basis or    at all. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from master    service agreements which may be cancelled by our customers upon    notice.  We currently derive approximately 73% of    our revenues from master service agreements. By their terms, the    majority of these contracts may be cancelled by our customers    upon notice, even if we are not in default. In addition, our    customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific    amount of work to us under these agreements. Consequently,    projected expenditures by customers are not assured until such    time as a definitive work order is placed and completed. The    loss of work obtained through master service agreements could    adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and    liquidity. We may be unable to renew master service agreements on    negotiated terms in the future.  During the last    several years we have been able to renew or extend some of our    master service agreements on negotiated terms rather than    through a competitive bidding process. Market conditions could    change, resulting in our customers requiring the renewal of    these contracts through competitive bidding, whereby we could be    underbid by our competitors. The loss of work obtained through    master service agreements could adversely affect our results of    operations, cash flows and liquidity. The industries we serve have experienced and may continue to    experience rapid technological, structural and competitive    changes that could reduce the need for our services and    adversely affect our revenues.  The    telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid    technological change, intense competition and changing consumer    needs. We generate a significant portion of our revenues from    customers in the telecommunications industry. New technologies,    or upgrades to existing technologies by customers, could reduce    the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues and    profitability. New, developing, or existing services, such as    wireless applications, could displace the wireline systems we    install and that are used by our customers to deliver services    to consumers. In addition, improvements in existing technology    may allow telecommunication companies to improve their networks    without physically upgrading them. Reduced demand for our    services or a loss of a significant customer could adversely    affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a    limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of    these customers could adversely impact our revenues and    profitability.  Our customer base is highly    concentrated, with our top five customers in fiscal years 2007,    2006, and 2005 accounting for approximately 63%, 64%, and 67% of    our total revenues from continuing operations, respectively. Our    revenue could significantly decline if we were to lose one or    more of our significant customers. In addition, revenues under    our contracts with significant customers may vary from    period-to-period depending on the timing and volume of work    which customers order in a given period or as a result of the    performance of work by the in-house service organizations of our    customers. Additionally, consolidations, mergers and    acquisitions in the telecommunications industry have occurred in    the past and may occur in the future. The consolidation, merger    or acquisition of an existing customer may result in a change in    procurement strategies by the surviving entity. Reduced demand    for our services or a change in procurement strategy of a    significant customer could adversely affect our results of    operations, cash flows and liquidity. We operate in a highly competitive    industry.  The specialty contracting services    industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete    with other independent contractors, including numerous small,    owner-operated private companies, as well as several companies    that may have financial, technical and marketing resources that    exceed our own. Relatively few barriers to entry exist to the    markets in which we operate and, as a result, any organization    with adequate financial resources and access to technical    expertise may become a competitor. Our competitors may develop    the expertise, experience and resources to provide services that    are equal or superior in both price and quality to our services,    and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive    position in our industry. We may also face competition from the    in-house service organizations of our customers which employ    personnel who perform some of the same types of services we    provide. Although our customers currently outsource a    significant portion of these services to us and our industry    competitors, we can offer no assurance that our existing or    prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty    contracting services in the future. Our financial results are based upon estimates and    assumptions that may differ from actual    results.  In preparing our consolidated financial    statements in conformity with accounting principles generally    accepted in the    8Table of Contents    United States, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by    management that affect the amounts reported in the financial    statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because    certain information that is used in the preparation of our    financial statements is either dependent on future events or    cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data    available. In some cases, these estimates are particularly    uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates    are primarily used in our assessment of the revenue recognition    for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings,    allowance for doubtful accounts, accrued self-insured claims,    valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, asset lives used in    computing depreciation and amortization, including amortization    of intangibles, and accounting for performance-based stock    awards, income taxes, contingencies and litigation. Actual    results could differ materially from the estimates and    assumptions that we use, which could have a material adverse    effect on our financial condition, results of operations and    cash flows. Our profitability is based on our ability to deliver our    services within the costs and estimates used to establish the    pricing of our contracts.  We recognize revenues    under the percentage of completion method of accounting using    the units of delivery or cost-to-cost measures. A significant    majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and    revenue is recognized as each unit is completed. As the price    for each of the units is fixed by the contract, our    profitability could decline if our actual costs to complete each    unit exceeds our original estimates. Revenues from contracts    using the cost-to-cost measures of completion are recognized    based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total    estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of    completion method of accounting requires that our management    estimate the costs to be incurred by us in performing the    contract. Our process for estimating costs is based upon the    professional knowledge and experience of our project managers    and financial professionals. However, any changes in original    estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may    result in revisions to costs and income and their effects would    be recognized in the period which such revisions are determined.    These changes could result in the reduction or elimination of    previously reported profits, which could adversely affect our    profitability and the price of our common stock. We possess a significant amount of accounts receivable and    costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings    assets.  We extend credit to our customers, which    include telephone companies, cable television multiple system    operators, and gas and electric utilities and others. At    July 28, 2007, we had net accounts receivable of    $146.9 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess    of billings of $95.4 million. We periodically assess the    credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the    timeliness of payments. Our customers may be adversely affected    by an economic downturn, which may subject us to potential    credit risks. In fiscal 2002, we recorded $20.6 million of    bad debt expense attributable to receivables due from Adelphia    and WorldCom, who filed for bankruptcy protection during fiscal    2002. If any of our significant customers were to experience    financial difficulties or file for bankruptcy, we could    experience difficulty in collecting what we are owed for work    already performed or in process, which could lead to reduced    cash flows and a decline in our liquidity. Additionally, we may    incur losses in excess of current bad debt allowances provided. We self insure against certain potential liabilities, which    leaves us exposed to higher than expected liability    claims.  We retain the risk of loss, up to certain    limits, for claims related to automobile liability, general    liability, workers compensation, employee group health,    and locate damages. We estimate and develop our accrual for    self-insured claims based on facts, circumstances and historical    evidence. However, the estimate for self-insured claims    liability remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part    on factors that cannot be known with precision. These factors    include the frequency of future claims, the payment pattern of    claims which have been incurred, changes in the medical    condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation,    tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury    decisions and court interpretations. Should a greater number of    claims occur compared to what we have estimated, or should the    dollar amount of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated,    our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur    substantial additional unanticipated charges. See Critical    Accounting Policies  Self-Insured Claims    Liability. Our backlog is subject to reduction    and/or    cancellation.  Our backlog consists of the    uncompleted portion of services to be performed under    job-specific contracts and the estimated value of future    services that we expect to provide under long-term requirements    contracts, including master service agreements. Many of our    contracts are multi-year agreements, and we include in our    backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over    the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience    with customers and, more generally, our experience in    procurements of this type. In many instances, our customers are    not contractually committed to procure specific    9Table of Contents    volumes of services under a contract. For certain multi-year    projects relating to fiber deployments for one of our    significant customers, we have included in the July 28,    2007 backlog amounts relating to anticipated work through the    remainder of calendar year 2007. These fiber deployment    projects, when initially installed, are not required for the    day-to-day provision of services by our customer. Consequently,    the fiber deployment projects of this customer generally have    been subject to more uncertainty, as compared to those of our    other customers, with regards to activity levels. Our estimates    of a customers requirements during a particular future    period may not be accurate at any point in time. If our    estimated backlog is significantly inaccurate or does not result    in future profits, this could adversely affect our future growth    and the price of our common stock. We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other    intangible assets.  In accordance with Statement    of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)    No. 142,  Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,    our reporting units and related intangible assets are tested    annually to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their    fair market value. Should this be the case, the value of the    goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles may be impaired and    written down. Goodwill and other intangible assets are also    tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or    circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the    fair value below the carrying value. If we determine the fair    value of the goodwill or other intangible asset is less than the    carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount    equal to the difference. Any such write-down could adversely    affect our results of operations. We recognized non-cash after    tax charges of approximately $29.0 million related to our    White Mountain Cable Construction reporting unit and    $14.8 million related to our Can-Am Communications, Inc.    reporting unit in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, respectively. The    impairment charges reduced the carrying value of goodwill    related to these reporting units as a result of our annual and    interim impairment analyses.     Our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units. Due to the    cyclical nature of our business, and the other factors described    under other Risk Factors
 herein, the profitability    of our individual reporting units may periodically suffer from    downturns in customer demand and other factors. These factors    may have a disproportionate impact on the individual reporting    units as compared to the Company as a whole and might adversely    affect the fair value of the individual reporting units. If    material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting    units, our future determinations of fair value may not support    the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units, and    the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount    considered recoverable. The loss of certain key managers could adversely affect our    business.  We depend on the services of our    executive officers and the senior management of our    subsidiaries. Our senior management team has many years of    experience in our industry, and the loss of any one of them    could negatively affect our ability to execute our business    strategy. Although we have entered into employment agreements    with our executive officers and certain other key employees, we    cannot guarantee that any key management personnel will remain    employed by us for any length of time. The loss of key    management could adversely affect the management of our    operations. We do not carry significant key-person    life insurance on any of our employees. Our business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to    attract and retain qualified employees.  Our    ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be    limited by our ability to employ, train and retain the skilled    personnel necessary to meet our requirements. We cannot be    certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled    labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our    growth strategy, which depends on a number of factors such as    general rates of employment, competitive demands for employees    having the skills we need and the level of compensation required    to hire and retain qualified employees. In addition, we cannot    be certain that our labor expenses will not increase as a result    of shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel. The    inability to hire qualified-employees or increased labor costs    could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our    revenues. Higher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business,    and we may not be able to pass along the added costs to    customers.  The price of fuel may fluctuate based    on events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not    allow us to adjust our pricing and therefore we have limited    ability to pass higher fuel costs to customers. Higher fuel    costs may negatively impact our financial condition and results    of operations. Our results of operations fluctuate    seasonally.  Our revenues are affected by    seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is    outdoors. Consequently, our operations are impacted by extended    periods of inclement weather. Generally, inclement weather is    more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during    our second and third fiscal quarters. A disproportionate    percentage of total paid holidays also fall within our second    10Table of Contents    quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays.    Additionally, our customer premise equipment installation    activities for cable providers historically decreases around    calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require    less activity during this period. As a result, we may experience    reduced revenues in the second and third fiscal quarters of each    year. We may be unable to generate internal    growth.  Our ability to generate internal growth    will be affected by, among other factors, our ability to offer    attractive services to existing customers, attract new    customers,  and hire and retain qualified employees or    subcontractors. Many of the factors affecting our ability to    generate internal growth may be beyond our control, such as the    capital budgets of our customers and the availability of    qualified employees. If we are unsuccessful, we may not be able    to achieve internal growth, expand our operations or grow our    business. Failure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could    adversely affect our business and results of    operations.  As part of our growth strategy, we    may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our    business. We regularly review various opportunities and    periodically engage in discussions regarding possible    acquisitions. Future acquisitions may expose us to operational    challenges and risks, including the diversion of    managements attention from our existing business, the    failure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquired    business, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquired    business for which there are inadequate reserves and the    potential impairment of acquired intangible assets. Our ability    to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may    be affected by our ability to successfully integrate any    businesses acquired. Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to    additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our    profitability.  We are subject to income taxes in    many different jurisdictions of the United States and certain of    our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income    to different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be    adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in    locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred    tax assets and liabilities, or tax laws. In particular, the    carrying value of deferred tax assets is dependent on our    ability to generate future taxable income. An increase to our    effective tax rate could reduce our profitability. In addition,    the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to    ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material    assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our    profitability. Our senior subordinated notes and revolving credit facility    impose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging in    transactions that might benefit us.  At    July 28, 2007, we had $150 million in senior    subordinated notes outstanding due February 2015. The notes were    issued under an indenture dated as of October 11, 2005. The    indenture contains covenants that, among other things, restrict    our ability to make certain payments, including the payment of    dividends, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, incur    additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make    investments, create liens, enter into sale and leaseback    transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell    assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. In    addition, our credit agreement requires us to (i) maintain    a consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than 3.00 to 1.0,    as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter,    (ii) maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than    2.75 to 1.00, as measured at the end of each fiscal quarter and    (iii) maintain consolidated tangible net worth, which shall    be calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter, of not less    than $50.0 million plus 50% of consolidated net income (if    positive) from September 8, 2005 to the date of computation    plus 75% of the equity issuances made from September 8,    2005 to the date of computation. A default under our credit    agreement or the indenture could result in the acceleration of    our obligations under either or both of those agreements as a    result of the cross acceleration and cross default provisions of    those agreements. In addition, these covenants may prevent us    from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including    responding to changing business and economic conditions or    securing additional financing, if needed. Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated    and the addition of new regulations or changes to existing    regulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialty    contracting services and the profitability of those    services.  Many of our telecommunications    customers are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission    (FCC). The FCC may interpret the application of its    regulations to telecommunication companies in a manner that is    different than the way such regulations are currently    interpreted and may impose additional regulations. If existing    or new regulations have an adverse affect on our    telecommunications customers and adversely impact the    profitability of the services they provide our customers may    reduce expenditures for the specialty contracting services we    provide.    11Table of ContentsWe may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impacts    relating to occupational health and safety    matters.  Our operations are subject to stringent    laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers    frequently operate heavy machinery and, as such, they are    subject to potential injury to themselves or others in the    vicinity of work being performed. If any of our workers or any    other persons are injured or killed in the course of our    operations, we could be found to have violated relevant safety    regulations, which could result in a fine or, in extreme cases,    criminal sanction. In addition, if our safety record were to    substantially deteriorate over time, customers could decide to    cancel our contracts and or not award us future business. Our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in    significant liabilities.  Our operations consist,    in part, of work performed underground. As a result, we are    potentially subject to material liabilities related to    encountering underground objects which may cause the release of    hazardous materials or substances. The environmental laws and    regulations which relate to our business include those regarding    the removal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste.    These laws and regulations can impose significant fines and    criminal sanctions for violations. Costs associated with the    discharge of hazardous materials or substances may include    clean-up    costs and related damages or liabilities. These costs could be    significant and could adversely affect our results of operations    and cash flows.     In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of    existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously    unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new    clean-up    requirements could require us to incur significant costs or    become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could    harm our financial condition and results of operations. We may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to    finance desired growth.  The use of cash for    acquisitions limits our financial flexibility and makes us more    likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity    financings. Our existing debt agreements contain significant    restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility,    including our ability to incur additional debt, and if we seek    more debt we may be required to agree to additional covenants    that limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we seek    additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that    additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms    acceptable to us or at all. We may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory    proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage    and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our    business and financial performance.   From time to    time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions,    including class action lawsuits, that are brought or threatened    against us for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards    Act (the FLSA) and state wage and hour laws. Due to    the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately    predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings. The    ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement,    mediation or court judgment could have a material adverse impact    on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash    flows. In addition, regardless of the outcome, these proceedings    could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote    substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of    current legal proceedings, see Note 19 to the consolidated    financial statements in this    Form 10-K. Anti-takeover provisions of Florida law, provisions in our    articles of incorporation and bylaws and our shareholder rights    plan could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of    our company or a change in our control.   Certain    provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could    delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the    replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For    example, our board of directors is divided into three classes.    At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only    have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the    directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles    of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without    further shareholder approval, to issue up to    1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with    such rights as our board of directors may determine. The    issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the    holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting    control to others. Our bylaws also restricted the right of    stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. We have    also adopted a shareholder rights plan which may make it more    difficult to effect a change in control. Lastly, we are subject    to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business    Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage    or prevent a change of control, even if such change would be    beneficial to stockholders. This could adversely affect the    market price of our common stock.    12Table of Contents "
7,DY,DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC,2006-09-11,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
     You should carefully consider the risks described below,together with all of the other information in thisForm 10-K. If anyof the following risks actually occur, or other risks notpresently known to us or that we do not currently believe to besignificant do develop and occur, our financial condition andresults of operations could suffer and the trading price of ourcommon stock could decline.     Demand for our services is cyclical, dependent in large parton the telecommunications industry and could be adverselyaffected by an economic slowdown. Demand for our serviceshas been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature andvulnerable to general downturns in the U.S. economy as wellas downturns in the telecommunications industry. In fiscal 2006,our telecommunications customers accounted for 72.9% of ourrevenues. In fiscal 2002 and the first half of fiscal 2003,certain segments of the telecommunications industry suffered asevere downturn that resulted in a number of our customersexperiencing financial difficulties. Several of our customersfiled for bankruptcy protection, including Adelphia andWorldCom. Additional bankruptcies or financial difficulties ofcompanies in the telecommunications sector could reduce our cashflows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability.During times of economic slowdown, the customers in theindustries we serve often reduce their capital expenditures anddefer or cancel pending infrastructure projects. Suchdevelopments occur even among customers that are notexperiencing financial difficulties. Future economic slowdownsin the industries we serve may impair the financial condition ofsome of our customers, which may cause them to reduce theircapital expenditures and demand for our specialty contractingservices and may hinder their ability to pay us on a timelybasis or at all.     We derive a significant portion of our revenues from masterservice agreements which may be cancelled. We may beunsuccessful in replacing these agreements as they are completedor expire. We currently derive approximately 64% of ourrevenues from master service agreements. By their terms, themajority of these contracts may be cancelled by our customersupon short notice, even if we are not in default under theseagreements. In addition, projected expenditures by customersunder these agreements are not assured until such time as adefinitive work order is placed and completed. If a significantcustomer cancels its master services agreement with us and wewere unable to replace the agreement on substantially similarterms, our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity couldbe adversely affected. Recently we have been able to extend someof these agreements on negotiated terms. Market conditions couldchange, however, and we may not be able to continue to obtain orextend master services agreements through negotiation, and maybe underbid by competitors in an ensuing competitive biddingprocess. The loss of work obtained through master serviceagreements or the inability to replace these agreements couldadversely affect our results of operations, cash flows andliquidity.     The industries we serve are subject to rapid technologicaland structural changes that could reduce the need for ourservices and adversely affect our revenues. Thetelecommunications industry is characterized by rapidtechnological change, evolving industry standards and changingcustomer needs. We generate a significant portion of ourrevenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. Newtechnology or upgrades to existing technology available to ourcustomers or to our customers competitors could reduce theneed for our services and adversely affect our revenues andprofitability. New or developing services, such as wirelessapplications, could displace the wireline systems used by ourcustomers to deliver services to consumers. In addition,improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunicationcompanies to improve their networks without physically upgradingthem. Additionally, consolidations, mergers and acquisitions inthe telecommunications industry have occurred in the past andmay occur in the future. These consolidations, mergers andacquisitions may cause the loss of one or more of our customers.Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significantcustomer could adversely affect our results of operations, cashflows and liquidity.     We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a fewcustomers, and the loss of one or more of these customers couldadversely impact our revenues and profitability. Ourcustomer base is highly concentrated, with our top fivecustomers in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004 accounting forapproximately 61%, 64%, and 64% of our total revenues,respectively. Our revenue could significantly decline if we loseone or more of our significant customers. In addition, revenuesunder our contracts with significant customers may vary from8Table of Contentsperiod-to-perioddepending on the timing and volume of work which such customersorder in a given period and as a result of competition from thein-house service organizations of our customers. Reduced demandfor our services or a loss of a significant customer couldadversely affect our results of operations, cash flows andliquidity.     We operate in a highly competitive industry. Thespecialty contracting services industry in which we operate ishighly competitive. We compete with other independentcontractors, including several that are large domestic companiesthat may have financial, technical and marketing resources thatexceed our own. Our competitors may develop the expertise,experience and resources to provide services that are equal orsuperior in both price and quality to our services, and we maynot be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. Wemay also face competition from the in-house serviceorganizations of our existing or prospective customers,particularly telecommunications providers, which employpersonnel who perform some of the same types of services as weprovide. Although our customers currently outsource asignificant portion of these services to us and our competitors,we can offer no assurance that our existing or prospectivecustomers will continue to outsource specialty contractingservices to us in the future. In addition, there are relativelyfew barriers to entry into the markets in which we operate and,as a result, any organization with adequate financial resourcesand access to technical expertise may become a competitor.     Our profitability is based on our ability to deliver ourservices within the costs and estimates used to establish thepricing of our contracts. Most of our long-term contractsare based on units of delivery, and we recognize revenue as theunit of delivery is completed. As the price for each of theunits is fixed by the contract, our profitability could declineif our actual costs to complete each unit exceeds our originalestimates. Revenue from other contracts is recognized usingcost-to-cost measuresof the percentage of completion method and is based on the ratioof contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contractcosts. Application of the percentage of completion method ofaccounting requires that our management estimate the costs to beincurred by us in performing the contract. Our process forestimating costs is based upon the professional knowledge andexperience of our project managers and financial professionals.However, any changes in original estimates, or the assumptionsunderpinning such estimates, may result in revisions to costsand income and their effects would be recognized in the periodduring which such revisions were determined. These changes couldresult in a reduction or elimination of previously reportedprofits, which could adversely affect our profitability and theprice of our common stock.     We have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costsand estimated earnings in excess of billings assets. Weextend credit to our customers, which include telephonecompanies, cable television multiple system operators, and othergas and electric utilities. At July 29, 2006, we had netaccounts receivable of $146.9 million and costs andestimated earnings in excess of billings of $79.5 million.We periodically assess the credit of our customers andcontinuously monitor the timeliness of payments. Our customersmay be adversely affected by an economic downturn, which maysubject us to potential credit risks. In fiscal 2002, werecorded $20.6 million of bad debt expense attributable toreceivables due from Adelphia and WorldCom. Adelphia andWorldCom both filed for bankruptcy protection during fiscal2002. If any of our significant customers file for bankruptcy orexperience financial difficulties, we could experiencedifficulty in collecting what we are owed by them for workalready performed or in process, which could lead to reducedcash flows and a decline in our liquidity. Additionally, we mayincur losses in excess of current allowances provided.     We self insure against certain potential liabilities, whichleaves us potentially exposed to higher than expected liabilityclaims. We retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits,for claims related to automobile liability, general liability,workers compensation, employee group health, and locatedamages. We estimate and develop our accrual for self-insuredclaims based on facts, circumstances and historical evidence.However, the calculation of the estimated accrued liability forself-insured claims remains inherently subject to uncertainty.Should a greater number of claims occur compared to what we haveestimated, or should the dollar amount of actual claims exceedwhat we anticipated, our recorded reserves may not besufficient, and we could incur substantial additionalunanticipated charges. See Critical AccountingPolicies  Self-Insured Claims Liability.9Table of Contents     Our backlog is subject to reduction and/or cancellation.Our backlog is comprised of the uncompleted portion of servicesto be performed under job-specific contracts and the estimatedvalue of future services that we expect to provide underlong-term requirements contracts, including master serviceagreements. In many instances our customers are notcontractually committed to specific volumes of services under acontract. Many of our contracts are multi-year agreements, andwe include in our backlog the amount of services projected to beperformed over the terms of the contracts based on ourhistorical relationships with customers and our experience inprocurements of this nature. For certain multi-year projectsrelating to fiber deployments for one of our significantcustomers, we have included in the July 29, 2006 backlogamounts relating to anticipated work in calendar years 2006 and2007. These fiber deployment projects, when initially installed,are not required for theday-to-day provision ofservices by our customer. Consequently, the fiber deploymentprojects of this customer generally have been subject to moreuncertainty, as compared to those of our other customers, withregards to activity levels. Our estimates of a customersrequirements during a particular future period may not beaccurate at any point in time. If our estimated backlog issignificantly inaccurate or does not result in future profits,this could adversely affect our results of operations, cashflows and liquidity.     We may incur impairment charges on goodwill or otherintangible assets in accordance with Statement of FinancialAccounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142,Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Inaccordance with SFAS No. 142, we conduct on at leastan annual basis a review of our reporting units to determinewhether the carrying value of their respective assets exceedstheir corresponding fair market value. Should this be the case,we would determine that the value of our goodwill is impairedand such goodwill would be written down. Any such write-downcould adversely affect our results of operations. During 2006,as the result of an interim impairment analysis, we recognized anon-cash after tax charge of approximately $14.8 million inorder to reduce the carrying value of goodwill related to ourCan-Am Communications, Inc. reporting unit. During 2005, werecognized a non-cash after tax charge of approximately$29.0 million in order to reduce the carrying value ofgoodwill related to our White Mountain Cable Constructionreporting unit as the result of our annual impairment analysis.     As a result of the purchase price allocations from our prioracquisitions and due to our decentralized structure, ourgoodwill is included in multiple reporting units. Due to thecyclical nature of our business, and the other factors describedunder other Risk Factors
 herein, the profitabilityof our individual reporting units may periodically suffer fromdownturns in customer demand and other factors. These factorsmay have a relatively more pronounced impact on the individualreporting units as compared to the Company as a whole and mightadversely affect the fair value of the reporting units. Ifmaterial adverse conditions occur that impact our reportingunits, our future determinations of fair value may not supportthe carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units, andthe related goodwill would need to be written down to an amountconsidered recoverable.     The loss of certain key managers could adversely affect ourbusiness. We depend on the performance of our executiveofficers and the senior management of our subsidiaries. Oursenior management team has numerous years of experience in ourindustry, and the loss of any of them could negatively affectour ability to execute our business strategy. Although we haveentered into employment agreements with our executive officersand certain other key employees, we cannot guarantee that anykey management personnel will remain with us for any length oftime. The loss of key management could adversely affect themanagement of our operations. We do not carry significantkey-person life insurance on any of our employees.     Our results of operations may fluctuate seasonally. Ourrevenues are affected by seasonality as most of our work isperformed outdoors. As a result, our operations are impacted byextended periods of inclement weather. Generally, inclementweather is more likely to occur during the winter season whichfalls during the second and third fiscal quarters. In addition,a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall withinour second quarter, which impacts the number of availableworkdays and paid holiday expense. As a result, we mayexperience reduced revenues in the second and third fiscalquarters of each year.     If we fail to integrate future acquisitions successfully,this could adversely affect our business and results ofoperations. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquirecompanies that expand, complement, or10Table of Contentsdiversify our business. We regularly review variousopportunities and periodically engage in discussions regardingsuch possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may expose us tooperational challenges and risks, including the diversion ofmanagements attention from our existing business, thefailure to retain key personnel or customers of an acquiredbusiness, the assumption of unknown liabilities of the acquiredbusiness for which there are inadequate reserves and thepotential impairment of acquired intangible assets. Our abilityto sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position maybe affected by our ability to successfully integrate anybusinesses acquired.     Unanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure toadditional income and other tax liabilities could affect ourprofitability. We are subject to income taxes in manydifferent jurisdictions of the United States and our taxliabilities are subject to the apportionment of income todifferent jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could beadversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings inlocations with differing tax rates, in the valuation of deferredtax assets and liabilities or in tax laws or by material auditassessments, which could affect our profitability. Inparticular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets isdependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. Inaddition, the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subjectto ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a materialassessment by a governing tax authority could affect ourprofitability.     Our revolving credit facility and senior subordinated notesimpose restrictions on us which may prevent us from engaging intransactions that might benefit us. At July 29, 2006,we had $150 million in senior subordinated notesoutstanding due February 2015. The notes were issued under anindenture dated as of October 11, 2005. The indenturecontains covenants that limit our ability to make certainpayments, including the payment of dividends, incur additionalindebtedness and issue preferred stock, create liens, enter intosale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate withanother entity, sell assets or enter into transactions withaffiliates. In addition, our credit agreement requires us to(i) maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not greaterthan 3.00 to 1.0, (ii) maintain an interest coverage ratioof not less than 2.75 to 1.00, as measured at the end of eachfiscal quarter and (iii) maintain consolidated tangible networth, which shall be calculated at the end of each fiscalquarter, of not less than $50.0 million plus 50% ofconsolidated net income (if positive) from September 8,2005 to the date of computation plus 75% of the equity issuancesmade from September 8, 2005 to the date of computation. Adefault could result in the acceleration of either ourobligations under the credit agreement or under the indenturerelating to the senior subordinated notes, or both. In addition,these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactionsthat benefit us, including responding to changing business andeconomic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.     Many of our telecommunications customers are highly regulatedand the addition of new regulations or changes to existingregulations may adversely impact their demand for our specialtycontracting services and the profitability of thoseservices. Many of our telecommunications customers areregulated by the FCC. The FCC may interpret the application ofits regulations to telecommunication companies in a manner thatis different than the way such regulations are currentlyinterpreted and may impose additional regulations. If existingor new regulations have an adverse affect on ourtelecommunications customers and adversely impact theprofitability of the services they provide, then demand for ourspecialty contracting services may be reduced.     Our operations expose us to various safety and environmentalregulations. We are required to comply with stringent lawsand regulations governing environmental protection and workplacesafety. With respect to safety, our workers frequently operateheavy machinery and, as such, they are subject to potentialinjury to themselves or others in the vicinity of work beingperformed. If any of our workers or any other persons areinjured or killed in the course of our operations, we could befound to have violated relevant safety regulations, which couldresult in a fine or, in extreme cases, criminal sanction.     A significant portion of our operations consist of workperformed underground. As a result, we are potentiallysubject to material liabilities related to encounteringunderground objects which may cause the release of hazardousmaterials or substances. The environmental laws and regulationswhich may relate to our business include those regarding theremoval and remediation of hazardous substances and waste.
