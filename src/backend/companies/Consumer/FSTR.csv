12,FSTR,FOSTER (LB) CO,2024-03-06,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRisks and UncertaintiesThe Company operates in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a material and adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following risk factors highlight what it believes to be the more material factors that have affected the Company and could affect it in the future. The Company has grouped the risk factors into five categories for ease of reading, and without any reflection on the importance of, or likelihood of, any particular category. The Company may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that it currently believes are immaterial. If any one or more such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. One should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any other risks discussed in our other periodic filings with the SEC before deciding to invest in our common stock.9Table of ContentsBusiness and Operational RisksOur inability to successfully manage acquisitions, divestitures, and other significant transactions or to otherwise execute our strategic plan could harm our financial results, business, and prospects.As part of our publicly-announced business strategy, we acquire or divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, make investments to realize anticipated benefits, or undertake cost-cutting initiatives, all of which are actions that involve a number of inherent risks and uncertainties. Material acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic transactions and initiatives involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to the following: •we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or we may not be able to dispose of assets, at prices we consider attractive;•we may not be able to compete successfully for identified acquisition candidates, complete future acquisitions or accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business;•future acquisitions may require us to spend significant cash and incur additional debt, resulting in additional leverage;•we may have difficulty retaining an acquired company’s key employees or clients;•we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies, synergies, costs savings, or other benefits expected;•we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses, resulting in unforeseen difficulties, such as incompatible accounting, information management or other control systems, or the need to significantly update and improve the acquired business’s systems and internal controls;•we may assume potential liabilities for actions of the target before the acquisition, including as a result of a failure to comply with applicable laws;•we may be subject to material indemnification obligations related to any assets that we dispose;•acquisitions or dispositions may disrupt our business or divert our management from other responsibilities; and•as a result of an acquisition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings.If these factors limit our ability to integrate the operations of our acquisitions or to execute other strategic transactions successfully or on a timely basis, we may not meet our expectations for future results of operations. In addition, our growth and operating strategies for businesses we acquire may be different from the strategies that such target businesses currently are pursuing. If our strategies are not the proper strategies for a company we acquire or with which we partner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance the profitability of any acquired business or consolidate the operations of any acquired business to achieve cost savings. In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on each company or business that we have already acquired or disposed of or may acquire or dispose of in the future. Such liabilities could include those arising from employee benefits contribution obligations of a prior owner or non-compliance with, or liability pursuant to, applicable federal, state, or local environmental requirements by us or by prior owners for which we, as a successor or predecessor owner, may be responsible. In addition, there may be additional costs relating to acquisitions and dispositions including, but not limited to, possible purchase price adjustments. There can be no assurance that rights to indemnification by sellers of assets to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We can give no assurances that the opportunities will be consummated or that financing will be available. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from strategic transactions as successfully or as rapidly as projected, if at all.Prolonged negative economic conditions, volatile energy prices, and other unfavorable changes in US, global, or regional economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.We could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers, as well as the capital markets. Negative changes in government spending may result in delayed or permanent deferrals of existing or potential projects. No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties, including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer orders and payments, and access to available capital resources outside of operations.In addition, volatile market conditions and depressed energy prices could continue for an extended period, which would negatively affect our business prospects and reduce profitability. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, a trend toward renewable or alternative energy resources, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Sustained declines or significant and frequent fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. Volatility in energy prices may also impact the Company’s plant costs, as well as overall conditions in passenger transit markets served.10Table of ContentsOur ability to maintain or improve our profitability could be adversely impacted by cost pressures.Our profitability is dependent upon the efficient use of our resources. Rising inflation, labor costs, labor disruptions, and other increases in costs due to tariffs or other reasons in the geographic areas in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations. During 2023 and 2022, the Company experienced increased costs in labor and materials as a result of the inflationary environment, competitive labor market, and supply chain constraints, which adversely impacted the Company’s profitability. We expect that these adverse impacts will continue but we are unable to predict the extent, nature, or duration of the impacts on our results of operations and financial condition at this time.Our success is in part dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our management information and communications systems.We recently completed an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system transition. Certain divisions of our Company migrated into the new ERP system during 2016 and additional divisions have since migrated, with the most recent migration completed in 2022. Acquired entities are also regularly assessed for transition onto the Company’s central ERP system. We also began the implementation of a global financial planning and consolidation system during 2021 that became operational in 2022. The system implementations are intended to enable us to better meet the information requirements of our users, increase our integration efficiencies, and identify additional synergies in the future. The implementation of our ERP system is complex because of the wide range of processes and systems to be integrated across our business. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, operation, or implementation of our various systems, or in the performance of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business, including our ability to receive, process, ship, and bill for orders in a timely manner or our ability to properly manage our inventory or accurately present our inventory availability or pricing. Project delays, business interruptions, or loss of expected benefits could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and other parties, including financial information, intellectual property, and personal identification information. Physical or electronic data or security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability, and harm our reputation and business. Cyber attacks on information systems constitute an ongoing risk across companies and industries, and although they have not historically had a material adverse effect on our business, in the past they have caused temporary disruption and interference with our operations. Despite the steps we take to deter and mitigate cybersecurity risks, we may not be successful. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent current or rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks including data and security breaches, malware, ransomware, hacking, and identity theft. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including an intentional or inadvertent physical or electronic data or security breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. In 2023, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new cybersecurity rules requiring disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents and processes assessing, identifying, and managing material cybersecurity risks and the corporate governance structure designed to address such risks.  Compliance with such rules could be costly and burdensome, and failure to adequately comply could have an adverse impact on the Company and its reputation.  Federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information obtained from customers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such data privacy laws and regulations, including those of the European Union (“EU”) and the UK which are, in some respects, more stringent than US standards, could be significant. Any compromise or breach of our security, including from the cyber-attack that we experienced or any future attack, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, legal and financial exposure, negative impacts on our customers’ willingness to transact business with us, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Certain divisions of our business depend on a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such supplier could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.In our Rail Products business unit, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers. Our Protective Coatings division is predominately dependent on two suppliers of epoxy coating. A significant downturn in the business of one or more of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us, or a disruption in the availability of rail or coating products and services may adversely impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price, quality, and availability of the primary raw materials used in our business could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Many of our businesses utilize steel as a significant product component. The steel industry is cyclical and prices and availability are subject to these cycles, as well as to international market forces. We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our precast products offerings. Our technology based solutions and services are dependent on electronic components and the ability to source these items. During 2023, the Company experienced increased raw material costs due to supply chain constraints and the inflationary environment. No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.11Table of ContentsLabor disputes may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.One of our manufacturing facilities is staffed by employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 11 employees employed at this facility are currently working under a collective bargaining agreement. Disputes with regard to the terms of this agreement or our potential inability to renegotiate an acceptable contract with this union could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a disruption of our operations and have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Actions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.In April of 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with an activist investor, 22NW, LP, and various of its affiliates (collectively, “22NW”) that had filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC with respect to the Company, which agreement provided that 22NW could appoint a non-voting Board Observer.  In January of 2024, the Company entered into a new cooperation agreement with 22NW providing for the nomination of the Board Observer to stand for election to the Board of Directors of the Company at the 2024 Annual Meeting of Shareholders in return for certain customary confidentiality and standstill provisions. 22NW remains a greater than 5% owner of Company stock.Activist investors may attempt to effect changes in the Company’s strategic direction and how the Company is governed, or to acquire control over the Company. Some investors seek to increase short-term shareholder value by advocating corporate actions, such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. While the Company welcomes varying opinions from all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of the Company’s board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.Our success is highly dependent on the continued service and availability of qualified personnel.Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, the executive team, and other highly skilled employees. The Company is experiencing a tight labor market which has constricted the labor pool and driven up labor costs as we compete for talent. Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to compete and lead to a reduction in our profitability.We may not foresee or be able to control certain events that could adversely affect our business or the stability of our supply chain.Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, flooding, and winter storms causing power failures or travel restrictions with respect to our operations, armed conflicts, terrorism, health epidemics, or pandemics such as COVID-19, and related restrictions on travel, economic or political uncertainties or instability, civil unrest, strikes, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or disruptions in certain areas of our operations, may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise negatively impact our financial performance. For example, we have in the past experienced unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products and services due to a global health pandemic, which adversely affected our operations and supply chain.Events such as these, or other catastrophic events, could in the future adversely affect our business and results of operations, including with respect to disruptions of our supply chain. If we do not successfully manage our supply chain or identify new sources of supplies, we may be unable to satisfy customer orders, which could harm our reputation and customer relationships and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. A pandemic-related outbreak or other disaster affecting any one of our facilities could result in production delays or otherwise interrupt our operations. US and non-domestic governmental and private pandemic mitigation measures such as stay-at-home orders can slow travel and movement of goods throughout the world, contributing to a reduction in demand for our products and services. Our supply chain could be negatively affected by global shipping disruptions, trade restrictions or embargoes or similar impacts arising from geopolitical conflict, including but not limited to the ongoing conflicts between Ukraine and Russia, or Israel and Hamas. Such conditions can also contribute to a tight labor market which in turn may adversely impact our supply chain.Competitive RisksOur business operates in highly competitive markets and a failure to react to changing market conditions could adversely impact our business.We face strong competition in each of the markets in which we operate. A slow response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines could negatively impact our overall pricing. Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories. We may be required to invest more heavily to maintain and expand our product 12Table of Contentsofferings. There can be no assurance that new product offerings will be widely accepted in the markets we serve. Significant negative developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.We possess and in some cases license intellectual property including proprietary rail product and precast concrete formulations and systems and component designs, and we own a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the US, Canada, Europe, and other countries in which product sales are possible. While we have not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property for all products in all countries, we periodically assess our portfolio to determine the need for pursuing further protection. The decision not to obtain patent and trademark protection in additional countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon our proprietary intellectual property. This, and failure to continue such licenses, could impede growth into new markets where we do not have such protections and result in a greater supply of similar products in such markets, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue. In some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect our intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets and confidential information rather than to apply for patents, which would involve disclosure of proprietary information to the public. Any misappropriation or reverse engineering of our trade secrets could result in competitive harm and may result in costly and time-consuming litigation. If any of these events should occur, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are dependent upon key customers.We could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers. A prolonged decrease in capital spending by our rail customers or decline in sales orders from other customers could negatively impact our sales and profitability. No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a current customer, or customers, or potential litigation with a current customer, would not also impact our future results of operations and/or financial condition.Financial RisksOur future performance and market value could cause write-downs of long-lived and intangible assets in future periods.We are required under US generally accepted accounting principles to review intangible and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may cause the carrying value of our intangible and long-lived assets to not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and resulting market capitalization, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. In 2022, the Company recorded goodwill impairment related to its Fabricated Bridge reporting unit. No impairments of goodwill or intangible assets were recorded in 2023. Impairment charges were recorded on long-lived assets related to the Company's precision measurement products and systems business during 2022.No assurances can be given that we will not be required to record future significant charges related to tangible or intangible asset impairments.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, it could:•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, or other general corporate purposes;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and•limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes.Our inability to comply with covenants in place or our inability to make the required principal and interest payments may cause an event of default, which could have a substantial adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, particularly if credit market conditions deteriorate. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions would be permitted by the terms of our credit agreements or debt instruments. Our existing credit agreements contain, and any future debt agreements we may enter into may contain, certain financial tests and other covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, acquire other businesses, and any such future debt agreements may impose various other restrictions. Our ability to comply with financial tests may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, and these covenants may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. We cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with the financial tests and other covenants, or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers or amended terms from our lenders. An uncured default with respect to one or more of the covenants could result in the amounts outstanding being declared immediately due and 13Table of Contentspayable, which may also trigger an obligation to redeem our outstanding debt securities and repay all other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Legal, Tax, and Regulatory RisksAn adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation or pending or future warranty claims against the Company or its subsidiaries or our determination that a customer has a substantial product warranty claim could negatively impact our financial results and/or our financial condition.We are party to various legal proceedings. In addition, from time to time our customers assert claims against us relating to the warranties which apply to products we have sold. There is the potential that an outcome adverse to us or our subsidiaries in pending or future legal proceedings or pending or future product warranty claims could materially exceed any accruals we have established and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition. In addition, we could suffer a significant loss of business from a customer who is dissatisfied with the resolution of a warranty claim.Violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws and other foreign governmental regulations, could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers, or both and could have a material and adverse effect on our business.The US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act, prohibit improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have established an internal control structure, corporate policies, compliance, and training processes to reduce the risk of violation, we cannot ensure that these procedures protect us from violations of such policies by our employees or agents. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, and suspension or debarment from contracting. Events of non-compliance could harm our reputation, reduce our revenues and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Violations of such laws or allegations of violation could disrupt our business and result in material adverse results to our operating results or future profitability.Our foreign operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, as well as US laws. These regulations include those related to currency conversion, repatriation of earnings, taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel, and the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers, including, in some jurisdictions, mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.We have certain tax attributes, including US federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards, and federal research and development credits, which may be available to offset future taxable income in certain jurisdictions.  Realization of these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that certain of our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in ownership by “5 percent shareholders” over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryovers and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Similar rules apply under US state tax laws. We have, and may in the future, experience ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change US net operating loss carryforwards to offset US federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liability could impact our profitability and management projections, estimates, and judgments, particularly with respect to reserves for litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities, may be inaccurate and not be indicative of our future performance.Our management team is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities. Certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management’s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control.We are required to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on evidence available at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amount of deferred taxes recognized, which can result in earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion of our deferred taxes.Shifting federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory policies impose risks to our operations.We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies and are therefore subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks, including those described in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 8, Financial 14Table of ContentsStatements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Like other companies engaged in environmentally sensitive businesses, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations, including environmental matters relating to, among other things, the treatment, disposal, and storage of wastes, investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the discharge of effluent into waterways, and the emissions of substances into the air. We are required to obtain various authorizations, permits, approvals, and certificates from governmental agencies. The Company could be subject to liability with respect to remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities and remediation of contamination by former owners or operators of the Company’s current or former facilities. Compliance with emerging regulatory initiatives, delays, discontinuations, or reversals of existing regulatory policies in the markets in which we operate, including costs associated with any required environmental remediation and monitoring, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.A substantial portion of our operations is heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects. Many of these projects have “Buy America” or “Buy American” provisions. Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results. Additionally, government actions concerning “Buy America” provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results.Government actions in the US or other countries where we have a higher concentration of business may change tax policy, trade policy, or enact other legislation that could create an unfavorable environment for the Company, making it more difficult to compete or adversely impact our operating results.Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change could have a material adverse effect on our business.Greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Such events could have a negative effect on our business. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation cost, and utility increases. Moreover, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may impact the productivity of our facilities, the operation of our supply chain, or consumer buying patterns. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.International RisksA portion of our sales are derived from our international operations, which expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.Doing business outside the US subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts, and unexpected changes in US and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments, and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign countries, including Brazil, Canada, China, India, Mexico, the UK, and countries within the EU, expose the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, be unable to alter our business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-US markets. Fluctuations in the relative values of the US dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro may result in volatile earnings that reflect exchange rate translation in our Canadian and European sales and operations. If the US dollar strengthens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro, our reported earnings in dollars from sales in those currencies will be unfavorable. Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the US dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro.Additionally, international trade agreements, including The United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (“USMCA”), could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Potential material modifications to USMCA, or certain other international trade agreements, including with respect to the modification of trade agreements with or among the EU and the UK, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Economic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.Pursuant to a June 2016 referendum, the UK left the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The UK government and the EU operated under a transitional arrangement that expired on December 31, 2020. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was agreed in principle and became provisionally operative on January 1, 2021, and formally in force on May 1, 2021, and terms of this new relationship between the UK and the EU remain subject to uncertainties. There has been volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar relative to the British pound, which could continue. The withdrawal of the UK from the EU has also created market volatility and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, political institutions, and regulatory agencies as negotiations of trade deals between the UK and the EU, and also between the UK and other countries, possibly including the US, occur during the near future. Brexit is an unprecedented event, and, accordingly, it is unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade, and legal effects will result.15Table of ContentsThe majority of our UK operations are heavily concentrated within the UK borders; however, this could adversely affect the future growth of our UK operations into other European locations. Our UK operations represented approximately 8% and 9% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 less than 1% of our consolidated net revenue was from the UK operation’s sales exported to EU members"
10,FSTR,FOSTER (LB) CO,2023-03-10,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRisks and UncertaintiesThe Company operates in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a material and adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following risk factors highlight what it believes to be the more material factors that have affected the Company and could affect it in the future. The Company has grouped the risk factors into five categories for ease of reading, and without any reflection on the importance of, or likelihood of, any particular category. The Company may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that it currently believes are immaterial. If any one or more such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. One should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any other risks discussed in our other periodic filings with the SEC before deciding to invest in our common stock.Business and Operational RisksOur inability to successfully manage acquisitions, divestitures, and other significant transactions could harm our financial results, business, and prospects.As part of our business strategy, we acquire or divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, or make investments to realize anticipated benefits, which are actions that involve a number of inherent risks and uncertainties. Material acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to: 9Table of Contents•we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or we may not be able to dispose of assets, at prices we consider attractive;•we may not be able to compete successfully for identified acquisition candidates, complete future acquisitions or accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business;•future acquisitions may require us to spend significant cash and incur additional debt, resulting in additional leverage;•we may have difficulty retaining an acquired company’s key employees or clients;•we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies, synergies, costs savings, or other benefits expected;•we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses, resulting in unforeseen difficulties, such as incompatible accounting, information management or other control systems, or the need to significantly update and improve the acquired business’s systems and internal controls;•we may assume potential liabilities for actions of the target before the acquisition, including as a result of a failure to comply with applicable laws;•we may be subject to material indemnification obligations related to any assets that we dispose;•acquisitions or dispositions may disrupt our business or divert our management from other responsibilities; and•as a result of an acquisition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings.If these factors limit our ability to integrate the operations of our acquisitions or to execute other strategic transactions successfully or on a timely basis, we may not meet our expectations for future results of operations. In addition, our growth and operating strategies for businesses we acquire may be different from the strategies that such target businesses currently are pursuing. If our strategies are not the proper strategies for a company we acquire or with which we partner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance the profitability of any acquired business or consolidate the operations of any acquired business to achieve cost savings. In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on each company or business that we have already acquired or disposed of or may acquire or dispose of in the future. Such liabilities could include those arising from employee benefits contribution obligations of a prior owner or non-compliance with, or liability pursuant to, applicable federal, state, or local environmental requirements by us or by prior owners for which we, as a successor or predecessor owner, may be responsible. In addition, there may be additional costs relating to acquisitions and dispositions including, but not limited to, possible purchase price adjustments. There can be no assurance that rights to indemnification by sellers of assets to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We can give no assurances that the opportunities will be consummated or that financing will be available. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from strategic transactions as successfully or as rapidly as projected, if at all.Prolonged negative economic conditions, volatile energy prices, and other unfavorable changes in U.S., global, or regional economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.We could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers, as well as the capital markets. Negative changes in government spending may result in delayed or permanent deferrals of existing or potential projects. No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties, including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer orders and payments, and access to available capital resources outside of operations.In addition, volatile market conditions and depressed energy prices could continue for an extended period, which would negatively affect our business prospects and reduce profitability. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, a trend toward renewable or alternative energy resources, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Sustained declines or significant and frequent fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Our ability to maintain or improve our profitability could be adversely impacted by cost pressures.Our profitability is dependent upon the efficient use of our resources. Rising inflation, labor costs, labor disruptions, and other increases in costs due to tariffs or other reasons in the geographic areas in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations. During 2022 and 2021, the Company experienced increased costs in labor and materials as a result of the inflationary environment, competitive labor market, and supply chain constraints, which adversely impacted the Company’s profitability. We expect that these adverse impacts will continue but we are unable to predict the extent, nature, or duration of the impacts on our results of operations and financial condition at this time.10Table of ContentsOur success is in part dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our management information and communications systems.We are currently working through an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system transition. Certain divisions of our Company migrated into the new ERP system during 2016, additional divisions have since migrated, including during 2022. We also began the implementation of a global financial planning and consolidation system during 2021 that became operational in 2022. The system implementations are intended to enable us to better meet the information requirements of our users, increase our integration efficiencies, and identify additional synergies in the future. The implementation of our ERP system is complex because of the wide range of processes and systems to be integrated across our business. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, operation, or implementation of our various systems, or in the performance of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business, including our ability to receive, process, ship, and bill for orders in a timely manner or our ability to properly manage our inventory or accurately present our inventory availability or pricing. Project delays, business interruptions, or loss of expected benefits could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and other parties, including financial information, intellectual property, and personal identification information. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability, and harm our reputation and business. In October 2020, we experienced a cyber-attack on our information technology systems. While the cyber-attack caused temporary disruption and interference with our operations, it did not result in a material adverse effect on our business operations. Despite the steps we take to deter and mitigate cybersecurity risks, we may not be successful. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent current or rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks including data and security breaches, malware, ransomware, hacking, and identity theft. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including an intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information obtained from customers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such data privacy laws and regulations, including those of the European Union (“E.U.”) and the U.K. which are, in some respects, more stringent than U.S. standards, could be significant. Any compromise or breach of our security, including from the cyber-attack that we experienced or any future attack, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, legal and financial exposure, negative impacts on our customers’ willingness to transact business with us, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Certain divisions of our business depend on a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such supplier could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.In our Rail Products business unit, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers. Our Protective Coatings division is predominately dependent on two suppliers of epoxy coating. A significant downturn in the business of one or more of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us, or a disruption in the availability of rail or coating products and services may adversely impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price, quality, and availability of the primary raw materials used in our business could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Many of our businesses utilize steel as a significant product component. The steel industry is cyclical and prices and availability are subject to these cycles, as well as to international market forces. We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our precast products and ties offerings. Our technology based solutions and services are dependent on electronic components and the ability to source these items. During 2022, the Company experienced increased raw material costs due to supply chain constraints and the inflationary environment. No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.Labor disputes may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Two of our manufacturing facilities are staffed by employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 44 employees employed at these facilities are currently working under two separate collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to renegotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a disruption of our operations and have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Actions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.Activist investors may attempt to effect changes in the Company’s strategic direction and how the Company is governed, or to acquire control over the Company. Some investors seek to increase short-term shareholder value by advocating corporate actions, such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. 11Table of ContentsWhile the Company welcomes varying opinions from all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of the Company’s board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.Our success is highly dependent on the continued service and availability of qualified personnel.Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, the executive team, and other highly skilled employees. As a result of the pandemic, the Company is experiencing a tight labor market which has constricted the labor pool and driven up labor costs as we compete for talent. Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to compete and lead to a reduction in our profitability.A pandemic could continue to adversely affect our business.The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and any future pandemics could adversely affect, our operations and supply chains and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products and services. If we do not successfully manage our supply chain or identify new sources of supplies, we may be unable to satisfy customer orders, which could harm our reputation and customer relationships and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Though we have implemented and enhanced safety measures and protocols in accordance with local government orders, a pandemic-related outbreak at any one of our facilities could result in production delays or otherwise interrupt our operations. While the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected each of the markets we serve, the impact on the midstream energy markets has been particularly adverse, and has contributed to volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas, weakened demand, and reduced customer spending. In the rail, transit, friction management, and fabricated steel products businesses, governmental stay-at-home orders and government and business work-from-home orders and arrangements in the U.S. and globally, particularly in the U.K., have resulted in reduced traffic and demand for our products and services, and many public works projects have been deferred or delayed as a result of governmental pandemic mitigation efforts, adversely impacting our businesses. U.S. and non-domestic governmental and private pandemic mitigation measures such as stay-at-home orders have slowed travel and movement of goods throughout the world, contributing to a reduction in demand for our products and services. Such measures have also contributed to a tight labor market which in turn adversely impacts our supply chain. We expect that these adverse impacts will continue but we are unable to predict the extent, nature, or duration of the impacts on our results of operations and financial condition at this time.We may not foresee or be able to control certain events that could adversely affect our business.Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, flooding, and winter storms causing power failures or travel restrictions with respect to our operations, armed conflicts, terrorism, health epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and related restrictions on travel, economic or political uncertainties or instability, civil unrest, strikes, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or disruptions in certain areas of our operations, may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise negatively impact our financial performance.Competitive RisksOur business operates in highly competitive markets and a failure to react to changing market conditions could adversely impact our business.We face strong competition in each of the markets in which we operate. A slow response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines could negatively impact our overall pricing. Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories. We may be required to invest more heavily to maintain and expand our product offerings. There can be no assurance that new product offerings will be widely accepted in the markets we serve. Significant negative developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.We possess and in some cases license intellectual property including proprietary rail product and precast concrete formulations and systems and component designs, and we own a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the U.S., Canada, Europe, and other countries in which product sales are possible. While we have not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property for all products in all countries, we periodically assess our portfolio to determine the need for pursuing further protection. The decision not to obtain patent and trademark protection in additional countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon our proprietary intellectual property. This, and failure to continue such licenses, could impede growth into new markets where we do not have such protections and result in a greater supply of similar 12Table of Contentsproducts in such markets, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue. In some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect our intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets and confidential information rather than to apply for patents, which would involve disclosure of proprietary information to the public. Any misappropriation or reverse engineering of our trade secrets could result in competitive harm and may result in costly and time-consuming litigation. If any of these events should occur, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are dependent upon key customers.We could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers. A prolonged decrease in capital spending by our rail customers or decline in sales orders from other customers could negatively impact our sales and profitability. No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a current customer, or customers, or potential litigation with a current customer, would not also impact our future results of operations and/or financial condition.Financial RisksOur future performance and market value could cause write-downs of long-lived and intangible assets in future periods.We are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to review intangible and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may cause the carrying value of our intangible and long-lived assets to not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and resulting market capitalization, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. In 2022, the Company recorded goodwill impairment related to its Fabricated Bridge reporting unit. No impairments of goodwill or intangible assets were recorded in 2021. Impairment charges were recorded on long-lived assets related to the Company's precision measurement products and systems business during 2022 and the since divested IOS Test and Inspection Services business during 2020.No assurances can be given that we will not be required to record future significant charges related to tangible or intangible asset impairments.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, it could:•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, or other general corporate purposes;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and•limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes.Our inability to comply with covenants in place or our inability to make the required principal and interest payments may cause an event of default, which could have a substantial adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, particularly if credit market conditions deteriorate. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions would be permitted by the terms of our credit agreements or debt instruments. Our existing credit agreements contain, and any future debt agreements we may enter into may contain, certain financial tests and other covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, acquire other businesses, and any such future debt agreements may impose various other restrictions. Our ability to comply with financial tests may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, and these covenants may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. We cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with the financial tests and other covenants, or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers or amended terms from our lenders. An uncured default with respect to one or more of the covenants could result in the amounts outstanding being declared immediately due and payable, which may also trigger an obligation to redeem our outstanding debt securities and repay all other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The phase-out of LIBOR and transition to SOFR as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse side effects.In advance of the cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) on June 30, 2023, on August 12, 2022, the Company amended its Credit Agreement to obtain approval for the VanHooseCo acquisition and temporarily modify certain financial covenants to accommodate the transaction. The Second Amendment also provided for the conversion from LIBOR-based to be based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Due to the broad use of LIBOR as a reference rate, the impact of this transition to SOFR could adversely affect our financing costs, including spread pricing on our senior secured facilities and any other variable rate debt obligations, as well as our operations and cash flows. There is no guarantee that the transition from LIBOR to SOFR will not 13Table of Contentsresult in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could affect our interest expense and earnings and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and stock price. Whether or not SOFR attains market acceptance as a LIBOR replacement tool remains uncertain.Legal, Tax, and Regulatory RisksAn adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation or pending or future warranty claims against the Company or its subsidiaries or our determination that a customer has a substantial product warranty claim could negatively impact our financial results and/or our financial condition.We are party to various legal proceedings. In addition, from time to time our customers assert claims against us relating to the warranties which apply to products we have sold. There is the potential that an outcome adverse to us or our subsidiaries in pending or future legal proceedings or pending or future product warranty claims could materially exceed any accruals we have established and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition. In addition, we could suffer a significant loss of business from a customer who is dissatisfied with the resolution of a warranty claim.Violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws and other foreign governmental regulations, could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers, or both and could have a material and adverse effect on our business.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, prohibit improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have established an internal control structure, corporate policies, compliance, and training processes to reduce the risk of violation, we cannot ensure that these procedures protect us from violations of such policies by our employees or agents. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, and suspension or debarment from contracting. Events of non-compliance could harm our reputation, reduce our revenues and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Violations of such laws or allegations of violation could disrupt our business and result in material adverse results to our operating results or future profitability.Our foreign operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, as well as U.S. laws. These regulations include those related to currency conversion, repatriation of earnings, taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel, and the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers, including, in some jurisdictions, mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets.Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.We have certain tax attributes, including U.S. federal, state and foreign operating loss carryforwards, and federal research and development credits, which may be available to offset future taxable income in certain jurisdictions.  Realization of these net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards depends on future income, and there is a risk that certain of our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50% change (by value) in ownership by “5 percent shareholders” over a rolling three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryovers and other pre-change tax attributes, such as research and development credits, to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Similar rules apply under U.S. state tax laws. We have, and may in the future, experience ownership changes as a result of shifts in our stock ownership. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change U.S. net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liability could impact our profitability and management projections, estimates, and judgments, particularly with respect to reserves for litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities, may be inaccurate and not be indicative of our future performance.Our management team is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities. Certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management’s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control.We are required to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on evidence available at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amount of deferred taxes recognized, which can result in earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion of our deferred taxes.Shifting federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory policies impose risks to our operations.We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies and are therefore subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks, including those described in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 8, Financial 14Table of ContentsStatements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Like other companies engaged in environmentally sensitive businesses, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations, including environmental matters relating to, among other things, the treatment, disposal, and storage of wastes, investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the discharge of effluent into waterways, and the emissions of substances into the air. We are required to obtain various authorizations, permits, approvals, and certificates from governmental agencies. The Company could be subject to liability with respect to remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities and remediation of contamination by former owners or operators of the Company’s current or former facilities. Compliance with emerging regulatory initiatives, delays, discontinuations, or reversals of existing regulatory policies in the markets in which we operate, including costs associated with any required environmental remediation and monitoring, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.A substantial portion of our operations is heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects. Many of these projects have “Buy America” or “Buy American” provisions. Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results. Additionally, government actions concerning “Buy America” provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results.Government actions in the U.S. or other countries where we have a higher concentration of business may change tax policy, trade policy, or enact other legislation that could create an unfavorable environment for the Company, making it more difficult to compete or adversely impact our operating results.The United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (“USMCA”) and certain other international trade agreements could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.On July 1, 2020, the USMCA became effective, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement. It is uncertain how the USMCA will impact foreign trade and our international operations. However, given the amount of North American trade that moves by truck and rail, it could have a significant impact on supply and demand for the raw materials that we use in manufacturing processes and for finished goods in the markets we serve, and could adversely impact the amount, movement, and patterns of products that we ship. Potential material modifications to USMCA, or certain other international trade agreements, including with respect to the modification of trade agreements with or among the E.U. and the U.K., may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Legislative or regulatory initiatives related to climate change could have a material adverse effect on our business.Greenhouse gases may have an adverse effect on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Such events could have a negative effect on our business. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, which could result in future tax, transportation cost, and utility increases. Moreover, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may impact the productivity of our facilities, the operation of our supply chain, or consumer buying patterns. Any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business.International RisksA portion of our sales are derived from our international operations, which expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.Doing business outside the U.S. subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts, and unexpected changes in U.S. and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments, and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign countries, including Brazil, Canada, China, India, Mexico, the U.K., and countries within the E.U., expose the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, be unable to alter our business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets. Fluctuations in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro may result in volatile earnings that reflect exchange rate translation in our Canadian and European sales and operations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro, our reported earnings in dollars from sales in those currencies will be unfavorable. Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the U.S. dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro.Economic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.Pursuant to a June 2016 referendum, the U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K. government and the E.U. operated under a transitional arrangement that expired on December 31, 2020. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was agreed in principle and became provisionally operative on January 1, 2021, and formally in force on May 1, 2021, and terms of this new relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. remains subject to uncertainties. There has been volatility in 15Table of Contentscurrency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, which could continue. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. has also created market volatility and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, political institutions, and regulatory agencies as negotiations of trade deals between the U.K. and the E.U., and also between the U.K. and other countries, possibly including the U.S., occur during the near future. Brexit is an unprecedented event, and, accordingly, it is unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade, and legal effects will result.The majority of our U.K. operations are heavily concentrated within the U.K. borders; however, this could adversely affect the future growth of our U.K. operations into other European locations. Our U.K. operations represented approximately 9% and 11% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 less than 1% of our consolidated net revenue was from the U.K. operation’s sales exported to E.U. members"
8,FSTR,FOSTER (LB) CO,2022-03-02,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRisks and UncertaintiesWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following risk factors highlight what we believe to be the more material factors that have affected us and could affect us in the future. We have grouped the risk factors into six categories for ease of reading, and without any reflection on the importance of, or likelihood of, any particular category. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently believe are immaterial. If any one or more such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. One should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any other risks discussed in our other periodic filings with the SEC before deciding to invest in our common stock.COVID-19 RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely affect our business.The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations and supply chains, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products and services. If we do not successfully manage our supply chain or identify new sources of supplies, we may be unable to satisfy customer orders, which could harm our reputation and customer relationships and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Though we have implemented safety measures and protocols in accordance with local government orders, an outbreak of COVID-19 at any one of our facilities could result in production delays or otherwise interrupt our operations. While COVID-19 has adversely affected each of the markets we serve, the impact on the midstream energy markets has been 9Table of Contentsparticularly adverse, and has contributed to volatility in the prices of oil and natural gas, weakened demand, and reduced customer spending. In the rail, transit, friction management, and fabricated steel products businesses, governmental stay-at-home and work-from-home orders both in the U.S. and globally, particularly in the U.K., have resulted in reduced traffic and demand for our products and services, and many public works projects have been deferred or delayed as a result of governmental pandemic mitigation efforts, adversely impacting our businesses. U.S. and non-domestic governmental and private pandemic mitigation measures such as stay-at-home orders have slowed travel and movement of goods throughout the world, contributing to reduction in demand for our products and services. Such measures have also contributed to a tight labor market which in turn adversely impacts our supply chain. We expect that these adverse impacts will continue but we are unable to predict the extent, nature, or duration of the impacts on our results of operations and financial condition at this time.Business and Operational RisksOur inability to successfully manage acquisitions, divestitures, and other significant transactions could harm our financial results, business, and prospects.As part of our business strategy, we acquire or divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, or make investments to realize anticipated benefits, actions which involve a number of inherent risks and uncertainties. Material acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to: •we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or we may not be able to dispose of assets, at prices we consider attractive;•we may not be able to compete successfully for identified acquisition candidates, complete future acquisitions or accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business;•future acquisitions may require us to spend significant cash and incur additional debt, resulting in additional leverage;•we may have difficulty retaining an acquired company’s key employees or clients;•we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies, synergies, costs savings, or other benefits expected;•we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses, resulting in unforeseen difficulties, such as incompatible accounting, information management or other control systems, or the need to significantly update and improve the acquired business’s systems and internal controls;•we may assume potential liabilities for actions of the target before the acquisition, including as a result of a failure to comply with applicable laws;•we may be subject to material indemnification obligations related to any assets that we dispose;•acquisitions or dispositions may disrupt our business or divert our management from other responsibilities; and•as a result of an acquisition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings.If these factors limit our ability to integrate the operations of our acquisitions or to execute other strategic transactions successfully or on a timely basis, we may not meet our expectations for future results of operations. In addition, our growth and operating strategies for businesses we acquire may be different from the strategies that such target businesses currently are pursuing. If our strategies are not the proper strategies for a company we acquire or with which we partner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance the profitability of any acquired business or consolidate the operations of any acquired business to achieve cost savings. In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on each company or business that we have already acquired or disposed of or may acquire or dispose of in the future. Such liabilities could include those arising from employee benefits contribution obligations of a prior owner or non-compliance with, or liability pursuant to, applicable federal, state, or local environmental requirements by us or by prior owners for which we, as a successor or predecessor owner, may be responsible. In addition, there may be additional costs relating to acquisitions and dispositions including, but not limited to, possible purchase price adjustments. There can be no assurance that rights to indemnification by sellers of assets to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We can give no assurances that the opportunities will be consummated or that financing will be available. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from strategic transactions as successfully or as rapidly as projected, if at all.Prolonged negative economic conditions, volatile energy prices, and other unfavorable changes in U.S., global, or regional economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.We could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers, as well as the capital markets. Negative changes in government spending may result in delayed or permanent deferrals of existing or potential projects. No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties, including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer orders and payments, and access to available capital resources outside of operations.10Table of ContentsIn addition, volatile market conditions and depressed energy prices could continue for an extended period, which would negatively affect our business prospects and reduce profitability. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, a trend toward renewable or alternative energy resources, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Sustained declines or significant and frequent fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Our ability to maintain or improve our profitability could be adversely impacted by cost pressures.Our profitability is dependent upon the efficient use of our resources. Rising inflation, labor costs, labor disruptions, and other increases in costs due to tariffs or other reasons in the geographic areas in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations. During 2021, the Company experienced increased costs in labor and materials as a result of the inflationary environment, competitive labor market, and supply chain constraints which adversely impacted the Company’s profitability. We expect that these adverse impacts will continue but we are unable to predict the extent, nature, or duration of the impacts on our results of operations and financial condition at this time.Our success is in part dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our management information and communications systems.We are currently working through an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system transition. Certain divisions of our Company migrated into the new ERP system during 2016, additional divisions have since migrated, including during 2021, and certain other divisions may be transitioned during 2022 and in subsequent years. We also began the implementation of a global financial planning and consolidation system during 2021 that will be operational in 2022. The system implementations are intended to enable us to better meet the information requirements of our users, increase our integration efficiencies, and identify additional synergies in the future. The implementation of our ERP system is complex because of the wide range of processes and systems to be integrated across our business. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, operation, or implementation of our various systems, or in the performance of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business, including our ability to receive, process, ship, and bill for orders in a timely manner or our ability to properly manage our inventory or accurately present our inventory availability or pricing. Project delays, business interruptions, or loss of expected benefits could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and other parties, including financial information, intellectual property, and personal identification information. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability, and harm our reputation and business. In October 2020, we experienced a cyber-attack on our information technology systems. While the cyber-attack caused temporary disruption and interference with our operations, it did not and will not result in a material adverse effect on our business operations. Despite the steps we take to deter and mitigate cybersecurity risks, we may not be successful. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent current or rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks including data and security breaches, malware, ransomware, hacking, and identity theft. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including an intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information obtained from customers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such data privacy laws and regulations, including those of the European Union (“E.U.”) and the U.K. which are, in some respects, more stringent than U.S. standards, could be significant. Any compromise or breach of our security, including from the cyber-attack that we experienced or any future attack, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, legal and financial exposure, negative impacts on our customers’ willingness to transact business with us, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Certain divisions of our business depend on a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such supplier could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.In our Rail Products business unit, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers. Our Protective Coatings division is predominately dependent on two suppliers of epoxy coating. A significant downturn in the business of one or more of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us, or a disruption in the availability of  rail or coating products and services may adversely impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price, quality, and availability of the primary raw materials used in our business could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Many of our businesses utilize steel as a significant product component. The steel industry is cyclical and prices and availability are subject to these cycles, as well as to international market forces. We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our precast products and ties offerings. Our technology based solutions and services are dependent on electronic components and the ability to source these items. During 2021, the Company experienced increasing costs of sources materials due to supply chain 11Table of Contentsconstraints and inflationary environment. No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.Labor disputes may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Three of our manufacturing facilities are staffed by employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 86 employees employed at these facilities are currently working under three separate collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to renegotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a disruption of our operations and have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Actions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.Activist investors may attempt to effect changes in the Company’s strategic direction and how the Company is governed, or to acquire control over the Company. Some investors seek to increase short-term shareholder value by advocating corporate actions, such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. While the Company welcomes varying opinions from all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of the Company’s board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.Our success is highly dependent on the continued service and availability of qualified personnel.Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, the executive team, and other highly skilled employees. As a result of the pandemic, the Company is experiencing a tight labor market which has constricted the labor pool and driven up labor costs as we compete for talent. Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to compete and lead to a reduction in our profitability.We may not foresee or be able to control certain events that could adversely affect our business.Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, flooding, and winter storms causing power failures or travel restrictions with respect to our operations, armed conflicts, terrorism, health epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, and related restrictions on travel, economic or political uncertainties or instability, civil unrest, strikes, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or disruptions in certain areas of our operations, may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise negatively impact our financial performance.Competitive RisksOur business operates in highly competitive markets and a failure to react to changing market conditions could adversely impact our business.We face strong competition in each of the markets in which we operate. A slow response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines could negatively impact our overall pricing. Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories. We may be required to invest more heavily to maintain and expand our product offerings. There can be no assurance that new product offerings will be widely accepted in the markets we serve. Significant negative developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.We possess intellectual property including proprietary rail product formulations and systems and component designs, and we own a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the U.S., Canada, Europe, and other countries in which product sales are possible. While we have not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property for all products in all countries, we periodically assess our portfolio to determine the need for pursuing further protection. The decision not to obtain patent and trademark protection in additional countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon our proprietary intellectual property. This could impede growth into new markets where we do not have such protections and result in a greater supply of similar products in such markets, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue. In some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect our intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets and confidential information rather than to apply for patents, which would involve disclosure of proprietary information to the public. Any misappropriation or reverse engineering of our trade secrets could result in competitive harm and may result in 12Table of Contentscostly and time-consuming litigation. If any of these events should occur, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are dependent upon key customers.We could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers. A prolonged decrease in capital spending by our rail customers or decline in sales orders from other customers could negatively impact our sales and profitability. No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a current customer, or customers, or potential litigation with a current customer, would not also impact our future results of operations and/or financial condition.Financial RisksOur future performance and market value could cause write-downs of long-lived and intangible assets in future periods.We are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to review intangible and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may cause the carrying value of our intangible and long-lived assets to not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and resulting market capitalization, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. No impairments of goodwill or intangible assets were recorded in 2021 and 2020. Impairment charges were recorded on long-lived assets related to the since divested IOS Test and Inspection Services business during 2020.No assurances can be given that we will not be required to record future significant charges related to tangible or intangible asset impairments.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, it could:•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, or other general corporate purposes;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and•limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes.Our inability to comply with covenants in place or our inability to make the required principal and interest payments may cause an event of default, which could have a substantial adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, particularly if credit market conditions deteriorate. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that refinancing or asset dispositions would be permitted by the terms of our credit agreements or debt instruments. Our existing credit agreements contain, and any future debt agreements we may enter into may contain, certain financial tests and other covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, acquire other businesses, and any such future debt agreements may impose various other restrictions. Our ability to comply with financial tests may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, and these covenants may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. We cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with the financial tests and other covenants, or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers or amended terms from our lenders. An uncured default with respect to one or more of the covenants could result in the amounts outstanding being declared immediately due and payable, which may also trigger an obligation to redeem our outstanding debt securities and repay all other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Certain portions of our variable rate debt, including our revolving credit facility, use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. The consequences of this and other developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but may result in an increase in the interest cost of our variable rate debt.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liability could impact our profitability and management projections, estimates, and judgments, particularly with respect to reserves for litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities, may be inaccurate and not be indicative of our future performance.Our management team is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities. Certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management’s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control.We are required to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on evidence available at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets 13Table of Contentswill not be realized. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amount of deferred taxes recognized, which can result in earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion of our deferred taxes.Legal, Tax, and Regulatory RisksAn adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation or pending or future warranty claims against the Company or its subsidiaries or our determination that a customer has a substantial product warranty claim could negatively impact our financial results and/or our financial condition.We are party to various legal proceedings. In addition, from time to time our customers assert claims against us relating to the warranties which apply to products we have sold. There is the potential that an outcome adverse to us or our subsidiaries in pending or future legal proceedings or pending or future product warranty claims could materially exceed any accruals we have established and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition. In addition, we could suffer a significant loss of business from a customer who is dissatisfied with the resolution of a warranty claim.Violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws and other foreign governmental regulations, could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers, or both and could have a material and adverse effect on our business.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, prohibit improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have established an internal control structure, corporate policies, compliance, and training processes to reduce the risk of violation, we cannot ensure that these procedures protect us from violations of such policies by our employees or agents. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, and suspension or debarment from contracting. Events of non-compliance could harm our reputation, reduce our revenues and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Violations of such laws or allegations of violation could disrupt our business and result in material adverse results to our operating results or future profitability.Our foreign operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, as well as U.S. laws. These regulations include those related to currency conversion, repatriation of earnings, taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel, and the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers, including, in some jurisdictions, mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets.Shifting federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory policies impose risks to our operations.We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies and are therefore subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks, including those described in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Like other companies engaged in environmentally sensitive businesses, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations, including environmental matters relating to, among other things, the treatment, disposal, and storage of wastes, investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the discharge of effluent into waterways, and the emissions of substances into the air. We are required to obtain various authorizations, permits, approvals, and certificates from governmental agencies. The Company could be subject to liability with respect to remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities and remediation of contamination by former owners or operators of the Company’s current or former facilities. Compliance with emerging regulatory initiatives, delays, discontinuations, or reversals of existing regulatory policies in the markets in which we operate, including costs associated with any required environmental remediation and monitoring, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.A substantial portion of our operations is heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects. Many of these projects have “Buy America” or “Buy American” provisions. Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results. Additionally, government actions concerning “Buy America” provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results.Government actions in the U.S. or other countries where we have a higher concentration of business may change tax policy, trade policy, or enact other legislation that could create an unfavorable environment for the Company, making it more difficult to compete or adversely impact our operating results.The United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (“USMCA”) and certain other international trade agreements could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.On July 1, 2020, the USMCA became effective, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement. It is uncertain how the USMCA will impact foreign trade and our international operations. However, given the amount of North American trade that moves by truck and rail, it could have a significant impact on supply and demand for the raw materials that we use in manufacturing processes and for finished goods in the markets we serve, and could adversely impact the amount, movement, and patterns of products that we ship. Potential material modifications to USMCA, or certain other international trade agreements, including with respect to the 14Table of Contentsmodification of trade agreements with or among the E.U. and the U.K., may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.International RisksA portion of our sales are derived from our international operations, which expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.Doing business outside the U.S. subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts, and unexpected changes in U.S. and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments, and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign countries, including Canada, China, India, Mexico, the U.K., and countries within the E.U., expose the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, be unable to alter our business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets. Fluctuations in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro may result in volatile earnings that reflect exchange rate translation in our Canadian and European sales and operations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro, our reported earnings in dollars from sales in those currencies will be unfavorable. Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the U.S. dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro.Economic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.Pursuant to a June 2016 referendum, the U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K. government and the E.U. operated under a transitional arrangement that expired on December 31, 2020. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was agreed in principle and became provisionally operative on January 1, 2021 and terms of this new relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. remains subject to uncertainties. There has been volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, which could continue. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. has also created market volatility and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, political institutions, and regulatory agencies as negotiations of trade deals between the U.K. and the E.U., and also between the U.K. and other countries, possibly including the U.S., occur during the near future. Brexit is an unprecedented event, and, accordingly, it is unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade, and legal effects will result.The majority of our U.K. operations are heavily concentrated within the U.K. borders; however, this could adversely affect the future growth of our U.K. operations into other European locations. Our U.K. operations represented approximately 11% and 9% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 less than 1% of our consolidated net revenue was from the U.K. operation’s sales exported to E.U. members"
0,FSTR,FOSTER (LB) CO,2021-03-03,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRisks and UncertaintiesWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following risks highlight what we believe to be the more material factors that have affected us and could affect us in the future. We have grouped the risk factors into six categories for ease of reading, and without any reflection on the importance of, or likelihood of, any particular category. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently believe are immaterial. If any one or more such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. One should carefully consider the following factors and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any other risks discussed in our other periodic filings with the SEC before deciding to invest in our common stock.COVID-19 RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely affect our business.The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations and supply chains, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products and services. If we do not successfully manage our supply chain or identify new sources of supplies, we may be unable to satisfy customer orders, which could harm our reputation and customer relationships and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. While COVID-19 has adversely affected each of the markets we serve, the impact on the upstream and midstream energy markets has been particularly adverse, and has contributed to deteriorating prices of oil and natural gas, weakened demand, and reduced customer spending. We expect these adverse market conditions, particularly in the oil and gas markets, to continue, noting that in 2020, the Company exited its upstream Test and Inspection Services business, reducing its overall exposure to oil and gas market volatility, but its Coatings and Measurement businesses remain. In the rail, transit, friction management, and fabricated steel products businesses, governmental stay-at-home and work-from-home orders both in the U.S. and globally, particularly in the U.K., have resulted in reduced traffic and demand for our products and services, and many public works projects have been deferred or delayed as a result of governmental pandemic mitigation efforts, adversely impacting our businesses. While the majority of our employees have generally been permitted to continue to work because our businesses are regarded as essential, U.S. and non-domestic governmental pandemic mitigation measures such as stay-at-home orders have slowed travel and movement of goods throughout the world, contributing to reduction in demand for our products and services. We expect that these adverse impacts will continue but we are unable to predict the extent, nature, or duration of the impacts on our results of operations and financial condition at this time.Business and Operational RisksOur inability to successfully manage acquisitions, divestitures, and other significant transactions could harm our financial results, business, and prospects.As part of our business strategy, we acquire or divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, or make investments to realize anticipated benefits, actions which involve a number of inherent risks and uncertainties. Material acquisitions, dispositions, and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to: •we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates, or we may not be able to dispose of assets, at prices we consider attractive;•we may not be able to compete successfully for identified acquisition candidates, complete future acquisitions or accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business; •future acquisitions may require us to spend significant cash and incur additional debt, resulting in additional leverage;•we may have difficulty retaining an acquired company’s key employees or clients;•we may not be able to realize the operating efficiencies, synergies, costs savings, or other benefits expected;9Table of Contents•we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses, resulting in unforeseen difficulties, such as incompatible accounting, information management or other control systems, or the need to significantly update and improve the acquired business’s systems and internal controls;•we may assume potential liabilities for actions of the target before the acquisition, including as a result of a failure to comply with applicable laws;•we may be subject to material indemnification obligations related to any assets that we dispose;•acquisitions or dispositions may disrupt our business or divert our management from other responsibilities; and•as a result of an acquisition, we may need to record write-downs from future impairments of intangible assets, which could reduce our future reported earnings.If these factors limit our ability to integrate the operations of our acquisitions or to execute other strategic transactions successfully or on a timely basis, we may not meet our expectations for future results of operations. In addition, our growth and operating strategies for businesses we acquire may be different from the strategies that such target businesses currently are pursuing. If our strategies are not the proper strategies for a company we acquire or with which we partner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or enhance the profitability of any acquired business or consolidate the operations of any acquired business to achieve cost savings. In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on each company or business that we have already acquired or disposed of or may acquire or dispose of in the future. Such liabilities could include those arising from employee benefits contribution obligations of a prior owner or non-compliance with, or liability pursuant to, applicable federal, state, or local environmental requirements by us or by prior owners for which we, as a successor or predecessor owner, may be responsible. In addition, there may be additional costs relating to acquisitions and dispositions including, but not limited to, possible purchase price adjustments. There can be no assurance that rights to indemnification by sellers of assets to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business. We can give no assurances that the opportunities will be consummated or that financing will be available. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from strategic transactions as successfully or as rapidly as projected, if at all.Prolonged negative economic conditions, depressed energy prices, and other unfavorable changes in U.S., global, or regional economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.We could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers, as well as the capital markets. Negative changes in government spending may result in delayed or permanent deferrals of existing or potential projects. No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties, including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer orders and payments, and access to available capital resources outside of operations.In addition, volatile market conditions and depressed energy prices could continue for an extended period, which would negatively affect our business prospects and reduce profitability. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, a trend toward renewable or alternative energy resources, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Sustained declines or significant and frequent fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Our ability to maintain or improve our profitability could be adversely impacted by cost pressures.Our profitability is dependent upon the efficient use of our resources. Rising inflation, labor costs, labor disruptions, and other increases in costs due to tariffs or other reasons in the geographic areas in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.Our success is in part dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our management information and communications systems.We are currently working through an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system transition. Certain divisions of our Company migrated into the new ERP system during 2016, additional divisions have since migrated, including during 2020, and certain other divisions may be transitioned during 2021 and in subsequent years. The system implementation is intended to enable us to better meet the information requirements of our users, increase our integration efficiencies, and identify additional synergies in the future. The implementation of our ERP system is complex because of the wide range of processes and systems to be integrated across our business. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, operation, or implementation of our various systems, or in the performance of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business, including our ability to receive, process, ship, and bill for orders in a timely manner or our ability to properly manage our inventory or accurately present our inventory availability or pricing. Project delays, business interruptions, or loss of expected benefits could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.10Table of ContentsWe are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and other parties, including financial information, intellectual property, and personal identification information. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability, and harm our reputation and business. In October 2020, we experienced a cyber-attack on our information technology systems. While the cyber-attack caused temporary disruption and interference with our operations, we believe that it will not result in a material adverse effect on our business operations, though our investigation is ongoing. Despite the steps we take to deter and mitigate cybersecurity risks, we may not be successful. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent current or rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks including data and security breaches, malware, ransomware, hacking, and identity theft. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including an intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information obtained from customers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such data privacy laws and regulations, including those of the European Union (“E.U.”) and the U.K. which are, in some respects, more stringent than U.S. standards, could be significant. Any compromise or breach of our security, including from the cyber-attack that we experienced or any future attack, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, legal and financial exposure, negative impacts on our customers’ willingness to transact business with us, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.Certain divisions of our business depend on a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such supplier could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.In our Rail Products business unit, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers. In addition, our Piling division is predominantly dependent upon one supplier for sheet piling while our Protective Coatings division is predominately dependent on two suppliers of epoxy coating. A significant downturn in the business of one or more of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us, or a disruption in the availability of existing and new piling, rail, or coating products and services may adversely impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price, quality, and availability of the primary raw materials used in our business could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Many of our businesses utilize steel as a significant product component. The steel industry is cyclical and prices and availability are subject to these cycles, as well as to international market forces. We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our Concrete Ties and Precast Concrete Products businesses. No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.Labor disputes may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Three of our manufacturing facilities are staffed by employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 92 employees employed at these facilities are currently working under three separate collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to renegotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a disruption of our operations and have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Actions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.In February 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with an activist investor, Legion Partners Asset Management, LLC and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “Legion Partners”), which had acquired a greater than 10% stake in our common stock. This agreement expired by its terms on February 13, 2018, and Legion Partners remains a greater than 5% owner of Company stock.Activist investors may attempt to effect changes in the Company’s strategic direction and how the Company is governed, or to acquire control over the Company. Some investors seek to increase short-term shareholder value by advocating corporate actions, such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. While the Company welcomes varying opinions from all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of the Company’s board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.11Table of ContentsOur success is highly dependent on the continued service and availability of qualified personnel.Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, the executive team, and other highly skilled employees. Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to compete and lead to a reduction in our profitability.We may not foresee or be able to control certain events that could adversely affect our business.Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, flooding, and winter storms causing power failures or travel restrictions with respect to our operations, armed conflicts, terrorism, health epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021 and related restrictions on travel, economic or political uncertainties or instability, civil unrest, strikes, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or disruptions in certain areas of our operations, may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise negatively impact our financial performance.Competitive RisksOur business operates in highly competitive markets and a failure to react to changing market conditions could adversely impact our business.We face strong competition in each of the markets in which we operate. A slow response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines could negatively impact our overall pricing. Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories. We may be required to invest more heavily to maintain and expand our product offerings. There can be no assurance that new product offerings will be widely accepted in the markets we serve. Significant negative developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.We possess intellectual property including proprietary rail product formulations and systems and component designs, and we own a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the United States, Canada, Europe, and other countries in which product sales are possible. While we have not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property for all products in all countries, we periodically assess our portfolio to determine the need for pursuing further protection. The decision not to obtain patent and trademark protection in additional countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon our proprietary intellectual property. This could impede growth into new markets where we do not have such protections and result in a greater supply of similar products in such markets, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue. In some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect our intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets and confidential information rather than to apply for patents, which would involve disclosure of proprietary information to the public. Any misappropriation or reverse engineering of our trade secrets could result in competitive harm and may result in costly and time-consuming litigation. If any of these events should occur, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are dependent upon key customers.We could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers. A prolonged decrease in capital spending by our rail customers or decline in sales orders from other customers could negatively impact our sales and profitability. No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a current customer, or customers, or potential litigation with a current customer, would not also impact our future results of operations and/or financial condition.Financial RisksOur future performance and market value could cause write-downs of long-lived and intangible assets in future periods.We are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to review intangible and long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may cause the carrying value of our intangible and long-lived assets to not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and resulting market capitalization, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. No impairments of goodwill or intangible assets were recorded in 2020, 2019, or 2018. Impairment charges were recorded on long-lived assets related to the since divested IOS Test and Inspection Services business during 2020.No assurances can be given that we will not be required to record future significant charges related to tangible or intangible asset impairments.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, it could:12Table of Contents•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to service our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, or other general corporate purposes;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and•limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes.Our inability to comply with covenants in place or our inability to make the required principal and interest payments may cause an event of default, which could have a substantial adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, particularly if credit market conditions deteriorate. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions would be permitted by the terms of our credit agreements or debt instruments. Our existing credit agreements contain, and any future debt agreements we may enter into may contain, certain financial tests and other covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, acquire other businesses, and any such future debt agreements may impose various other restrictions. Our ability to comply with financial tests may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, and these covenants may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. We cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with the financial tests and other covenants, or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers or amended terms from our lenders. An uncured default with respect to one or more of the covenants could result in the amounts outstanding being declared immediately due and payable, which may also trigger an obligation to redeem our outstanding debt securities and repay all other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Certain portions of our variable rate debt, including our revolving credit facility, currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. The SEC staff has stated that “[i]t is expected that a number of private-sector banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021 when their current reporting commitment ends, which could either cause LIBOR to stop publication immediately or cause LIBOR’s regulator to determine that its quality has degraded to the degree that it is no longer representative of its underlying market.” The consequences of this and other developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but may result in an increase in the interest cost of our variable rate debt.Changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liability could impact our profitability and management projections, estimates, and judgments, particularly with respect to reserves for litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities, may be inaccurate and not be indicative of our future performance.Our management team is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities. Certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management’s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control.We are required to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on evidence available at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amount of deferred taxes recognized, which can result in earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion of our deferred taxes. Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion related to relating to legal proceedings and compliance risksLegal, Tax, and Regulatory RisksAn adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation or pending or future warranty claims against the Company or its subsidiaries or our determination that a customer has a substantial product warranty claim could negatively impact our financial results and/or our financial condition.We are party to various legal proceedings. In addition, from time to time our customers assert claims against us relating to the warranties which apply to products we have sold. There is the potential that an outcome adverse to us or our subsidiaries in pending or future legal proceedings or pending or future product warranty claims could materially exceed any accruals we have established and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition. In addition, we could suffer a significant loss of business from a customer who is dissatisfied with the resolution of a warranty claim.13Table of ContentsViolations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws and other foreign governmental regulations, could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers, or both and could have a material and adverse effect on our business.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, prohibit improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have established an internal control structure, corporate policies, compliance, and training processes to reduce the risk of violation, we cannot ensure that these procedures protect us from violations of such policies by our employees or agents. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, and suspension or debarment from contracting. Events of non-compliance could harm our reputation, reduce our revenues and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Violations of such laws or allegations of violation could disrupt our business and result in material adverse results to our operating results or future profitability.Our foreign operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, as well as U.S. laws. These regulations include those related to currency conversion, repatriation of earnings, taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel, and the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers, including, in some jurisdictions, mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets.Shifting federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory policies impose risks to our operations.We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies and are therefore subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks, including those described in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Like other companies engaged in environmentally sensitive businesses, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations, including environmental matters relating to, among other things, the treatment, disposal, and storage of wastes, investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the discharge of effluent into waterways, and the emissions of substances into the air. We are required to obtain various authorizations, permits, approvals, and certificates from governmental agencies. The Company could be subject to liability with respect to remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities and remediation of contamination by former owners or operators of the Company’s current or former facilities. Compliance with emerging regulatory initiatives, delays, discontinuations, or reversals of existing regulatory policies in the markets in which we operate, including costs associated with any required environmental remediation and monitoring, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.A substantial portion of our operations is heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects. Many of these projects have “Buy America” or “Buy American” provisions. Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results. Additionally, government actions concerning “Buy America” provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results.Government actions in the United States or other countries where we have a higher concentration of business may change tax policy, trade policy, or enact other legislation that could create an unfavorable environment for the Company, making it more difficult to compete or adversely impact our operating results.The United States-Mexico-Canada Trade Agreement (“USMCA”) and certain other international trade agreements could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.On July 1, 2020, the USMCA became effective, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement. It is uncertain how the USMCA will impact foreign trade and our international operations. Potential material modifications to USMCA, or certain other international trade agreements, including with respect to the modification of trade agreements with or among the E.U. and the U.K., may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.International RisksA portion of our sales are derived from our international operations, which expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.Doing business outside the United States subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts, and unexpected changes in U.S. and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments, and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign countries, including Canada, China, India, Mexico, the U.K., and countries within the E.U., expose the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, be unable to alter our business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets. Fluctuations in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro may result in volatile earnings that reflect exchange rate translation in our Canadian and European sales and operations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro, our reported earnings in dollars from sales in those currencies will be unfavorable. Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the U.S. dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro.14Table of ContentsEconomic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.Pursuant to a June 2016 referendum, the U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K. government and the E.U. operated under a transitional arrangement that expired on December 31, 2020. The EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement was agreed in principle and became provisionally operative on January 1, 2021 and terms of this new relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. remains subject to uncertainties. There has been volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, which could continue. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. has also created market volatility and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, political institutions, and regulatory agencies as negotiations of trade deals between the U.K. and the E.U., and also between the U.K. and other countries, possibly including the U.S., occur during the near future. Brexit is an unprecedented event, and, accordingly, it is unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade, and legal effects will result.The majority of our U.K. operations are heavily concentrated within the U.K. borders; however, this could adversely affect the future growth of our U.K. operations into other European locations. Our U.K. operations represented approximately 9%, 9%, and 11% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, less than 1% of our consolidated net revenue was from the U.K. operation’s sales exported to E.U. members"
17,FSTR,FOSTER (LB) CO,2020-02-27,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRisks and UncertaintiesWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following risks highlight some of the more significant factors that have affected us and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently believe are immaterial. If any one or more such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. One should carefully consider the following factors and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and any other risks discussed in our other periodic filings with the SEC before deciding to invest in our common stock.Our inability to successfully manage divestitures and other significant transactions could harm our financial results, business, and prospects.As part of our business strategy, we may divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, or make investments to realize anticipated benefits, actions which involve a number of inherent risks and uncertainties. We can give no assurances that the opportunities will be consummated or that financing will be available. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from strategic transactions as successfully or as rapidly as projected, if at all.Our future performance and market value could cause write-downs of long-lived and intangible assets in future periods.We are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to review intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered to be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and resulting market capitalization, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. No impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets were recorded in 2019 or 2018.No assurances can be given that we will not be required to record future significant charges related to tangible or intangible asset impairments.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, it could:•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments of our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, or other general corporate purposes;8Table of Contents•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate;•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and•limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, or other general corporate purposes.Our inability to comply with covenants in place or our inability to make the required principal and interest payments may cause an event of default, which could have a substantial adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, particularly if credit market conditions deteriorate. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions would be permitted by the terms of our credit agreements or debt instruments. Our existing credit agreements contain, and any future debt agreements we may enter into may contain, certain financial tests and other covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, acquire other businesses, and may impose various other restrictions. Our ability to comply with financial tests may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, and these covenants may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. We cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with the financial tests and other covenants, or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers or amended terms from our lenders. An uncured default with respect to one or more of the covenants could result in the amounts outstanding being declared immediately due and payable, which may also trigger an obligation to redeem our outstanding debt securities and repay all other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Certain portions of our variable rate debt, including our revolving credit facility, currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. The SEC staff has stated that “[i]t is expected that a number of private-sector banks currently reporting information used to set LIBOR will stop doing so after 2021 when their current reporting commitment ends, which could either cause LIBOR to stop publication immediately or cause LIBOR’s regulator to determine that its quality has degraded to the degree that it is no longer representative of its underlying market.” The consequences of this and other developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but may result in an increase in the interest cost of our variable rate debt.Prolonged depressed energy prices and other unfavorable changes in U.S., global, or regional economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.We could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative changes in economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers, as well as the capital markets. Negative changes in government spending may result in delayed or permanent deferrals of existing or potential projects. No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties, including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer orders and payments, and access to available capital resources outside of operations.In addition, volatile market conditions and depressed energy prices could continue for an extended period, which would negatively affect our business prospects and reduce profitability. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Sustained declines or significant and frequent fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Our ability to maintain or improve our profitability could be adversely impacted by cost pressures.Our profitability is dependent upon the efficient use of our resources. Rising inflation, labor costs, labor disruptions, and other increases in costs due to tariffs or other reasons in the geographic areas in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.Management projections, estimates, and judgments may not be indicative of our future performance.Our management team is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities. Certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management’s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control.We are required to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income if we determine, based on evidence available at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amount of deferred taxes recognized, which can result in earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional discussion of our deferred taxes.Our business operates in highly competitive markets and a failure to react to changing market conditions could adversely impact our business.We face strong competition in each of the markets in which we operate. A slow response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines could negatively impact our overall pricing. Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories. We may be required to invest more heavily to maintain and expand our product 9Table of Contentsofferings. There can be no assurance that new product offerings will be widely accepted in the markets we serve. Significant negative developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.We own a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the United States, Canada, Europe, and other countries in which product sales are possible. However, we have not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property for all products in all countries. The decision not to obtain patent and trademark protection in additional countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon our proprietary intellectual property. This could impede growth into new markets where we do not have such protections and result in a greater supply of similar products in such markets, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue.Our success is in part dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our management information and communications systems.We are currently working through an enterprise resource program (“ERP”) system transition. Certain divisions of our Company migrated into the new ERP system during 2016, additional divisions migrated during 2019, and certain other divisions may be transitioned during 2020 and subsequent years. The system implementation is intended to enable us to better meet the information requirements of our users, increase our integration efficiencies, and identify additional synergies in the future. The implementation of our ERP system is complex because of the wide range of processes and systems to be integrated across our business. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, operation, or implementation of our various systems, or in the performance of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business, including our ability to receive, process, ship, and bill for orders in a timely manner or our ability to properly manage our inventory or accurately present our inventory availability or pricing. Project delays, business interruptions, or loss of expected benefits could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and other parties, including financial information, intellectual property, and personal identification information. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability, and harm our reputation and business. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent current or rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including an intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering the adoption of laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information obtained from customers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such data privacy laws and regulations, including those of the European Union (“E.U.”) and the U.K. which are, in some respects, more stringent than U.S. standards, could be significant. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, legal and financial exposure, negative impacts on our customers’ willingness to transact business with us, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.We are dependent upon key customers.We could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers. A prolonged decrease in capital spending by our rail customers or decline in sales orders from other customers could negatively impact our sales and profitability. No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a current customer, or customers, or potential litigation with a current customer, would not also impact our future results of operations and/or financial condition.An adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation or pending or future warranty claims against the Company or its subsidiaries or our determination that a customer has a substantial product warranty claim could negatively impact our financial results and/or our financial condition.We are party to various legal proceedings. In addition, from time to time our customers assert claims against us relating to the warranties which apply to products we have sold. There is the potential that an outcome adverse to us or our subsidiaries in pending or future legal proceedings or pending or future product warranty claims could materially exceed any accruals we have established and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition. In addition, we could suffer a significant loss of business from a customer who is dissatisfied with the resolution of a warranty claim.A portion of our sales are derived from our international operations, which expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.Doing business outside the United States subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts, and unexpected changes in U.S. and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments, and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign 10Table of Contentscountries, including Canada, China, India, Mexico, the U.K., and countries within the E.U., exposes the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, unable to alter our business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets. Fluctuations in the relative values of the U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro may result in volatile earnings to reflect exchange rate translation in our Canadian and European sales and operations. If the U.S. dollar strengthens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro, our reported earnings in dollars from sales in those currencies will be unfavorable. Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the U.S. dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro.Economic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.Pursuant to a June 2016 referendum, the U.K. left the E.U. on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K. government and the E.U. are operating under a transitional arrangement that expires on December 31, 2020, and the parties are working on the terms of a future relationship, including a potential trade agreement. The nature and terms of the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. remain subject to negotiation and uncertain. Additionally, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainties related to applicable laws and regulations that apply to our operations and as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws and regulations to adopt, replace, or disregard. There has been volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar relative to the British pound, which could continue. The withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. has also created market volatility and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, political institutions, and regulatory agencies as negotiations of trade deals between the U.K. and the E.U., and also between the U.K. and other countries, possibly including the U.S., occur during the transition period. Brexit is an unprecedented event, and, accordingly, it is unclear what long-term economic, financial, trade, and legal effects will result.The majority of our U.K. operations are heavily concentrated within the U.K. borders; however, this could adversely affect the future growth of our U.K. operations into other European locations. Our U.K. operations represented approximately 9% and 11% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, less than 1% of our consolidated net revenue was from the U.K. operation’s sales exported to E.U. members other than the U.K.Material modification to the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and certain other international trade agreements could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The current Presidential administration has made comments suggesting it is not supportive of certain international trade agreements, including NAFTA. On November 30, 2018, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) was signed by the parties, and has been ratified by each country except Canada. At this time, it remains unclear what the current administration and Congress would or would not do with respect to these international trade agreements. Potential material modifications to NAFTA, or certain other international trade agreements, including USMCA, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Violations of foreign governmental regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers, or both and could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Our foreign operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate, as well as U.S. laws. These regulations include those related to currency conversion, repatriation of earnings, taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel, and the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers, including, in some jurisdictions, mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, prohibit improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have established an internal control structure, corporate policies, compliance, and training processes to reduce the risk of violation, we cannot ensure that these procedures protect us from violations of such policies by our employees or agents. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, and suspension or debarment from contracting. Events of non-compliance could harm our reputation, reduce our revenues and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Violations of such laws or allegations of violation could disrupt our business and result in material adverse results to our operating results or future profitability.Certain divisions of our business depend on a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such supplier could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.In our Rail Products business unit, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers. In addition, our Piling division is predominantly dependent upon one supplier for sheet piling while our Protective Coatings division is predominately dependent on two suppliers of epoxy coating. A significant downturn in the business of one or more of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us, or a disruption in the availability of existing and new piling and rail products may adversely impact our financial results.11Table of ContentsFluctuations in the price, quality, and availability of the primary raw materials used in our business could have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Many of our businesses utilize steel as a significant product component. The steel industry is cyclical and prices and availability are subject to these cycles, as well as to international market forces. We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our Concrete Ties and Precast Concrete Products businesses. No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.Labor disputes may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Four of our manufacturing facilities are staffed by employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 111 employees employed at these facilities are currently working under three separate collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to renegotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a disruption of our operations and have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Actions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.In February 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with an activist investor, Legion Partners Asset Management, LLC and various of its affiliates (collectively, “Legion Partners”) that had filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC with respect to the Company. This agreement expired by its terms on February 13, 2018, and Legion Partners remains a greater than 5% owner of Company stock.Activist investors may attempt to effect changes in the Company’s strategic direction and how the Company is governed, or to acquire control over the Company. Some investors seek to increase short-term shareholder value by advocating corporate actions, such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. While the Company welcomes varying opinions from all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of the Company’s board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.Our success is highly dependent on the continued service and availability of qualified personnel.Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, the executive team, and other highly skilled employees. Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to compete and lead to a reduction in our profitability.We may not foresee or be able to control certain events that could adversely affect our business.Unexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, armed conflicts, terrorism, health epidemics or pandemics, economic or political uncertainties or instability, civil unrest, strikes, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or disruptions in certain areas of our operations, may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise negatively impact our financial performance.Shifting federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory policies impose risks to our operations.We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies and are therefore subject to a variety of legal proceedings and compliance risks, including those described in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Like other companies engaged in environmentally sensitive businesses, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations, including environmental matters relating to, among other things, the treatment, disposal, and storage of wastes, investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the discharge of effluent into waterways, and the emissions of substances into the air. We are required to obtain various authorizations, permits, approvals, and certificates from governmental agencies. The Company could be subject to liability with respect to remediation of past contamination in the operation of some of its current and former facilities and remediation of contamination by former owners or operators of the Company’s current or former facilities. Compliance with emerging regulatory initiatives, delays, discontinuations, or reversals of existing regulatory policies in the markets in which we operate, including costs associated with any required environmental remediation and monitoring, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.A substantial portion of our operations is heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects. Many of these projects have “Buy America” or “Buy American” provisions. Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results. Additionally, government actions concerning “Buy America” provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results.12Table of Contents"
1,FSTR,FOSTER (LB) CO,2019-03-18,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSRisks and UncertaintiesWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following risks highlight some of the more significant factors that have affected us and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently believe are immaterial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in our common stock.Our inability to successfully manage divestitures and other significant transactions could harm our financial results, business, and prospects.As part of our business strategy, we may divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, and make investments to realize anticipated benefits, which actions involve a number of inherent risks and uncertainties. We can give no assurances that the opportunities will be consummated or that financing will be available. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from strategic transactions as successfully or rapidly as projected, if at all.Our future performance and market value could cause additional write-downs of long-lived and intangible assets in future periods.We are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to review intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In addition, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered to be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and resulting market capitalization, a8Table of Contents significant decrease in the market value of an asset, or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. No impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets were recorded in 2018 and 2017.No assurances can be given that we will not be required to record future significant charges related to tangible or intangible asset impairments.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.Our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, it could:•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments of our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, and other general corporate purposes;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and•limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes.Our inability to comply with covenants in place or our inability to make the required principal and interest payments may cause an event of default, which could have a substantial adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, particularly if credit market conditions deteriorate. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions would be permitted by the terms of our credit agreements or debt instruments. Our existing credit agreements contain, and any future debt agreements we may enter into may contain, certain financial tests and other covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, acquire other businesses, and may impose various other restrictions. Our ability to comply with financial tests may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, and these covenants may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. We cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with the financial tests and other covenants, or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers or amended terms from our lenders. An uncured default with respect to one or more of the covenants could result in the amounts outstanding being declared immediately due and payable, which may also trigger an obligation to redeem our outstanding debt securities and repay all other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Certain of our variable rate debt, including our revolving credit facility, currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but may result in an increase in the interest cost of our variable rate debt.Prolonged low energy prices and other unfavorable changes in U.S., global, or regional economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.We could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative changes in economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers as well as the capital markets. Negative changes in government spending may result in delayed or permanent deferrals of existing or potential projects. No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer orders and payments, and access to available capital resources outside of operations.In addition, volatile market conditions and low energy prices could continue for an extended period, which would negatively affect our business prospects and reduce profitability. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Sustained declines or significant and frequent fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas may have a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Our ability to maintain or improve our profitability could be adversely impacted by cost pressures.Our profitability is dependent upon the efficient use of our resources. Rising inflation, labor costs, labor disruptions, and other increases in costs due to tariffs or other reasons in the geographic areas in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.Management projections, estimates, and judgments may not be indicative of our future performance.Our management team is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities. Certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management’s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control.9Table of ContentsWe are required to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income and equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for additional discussion of our deferred taxes.Our business operates in highly competitive markets and a failure to react to changing market conditions could adversely impact our business.We face strong competition in each of the markets in which we participate. A slow response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines could negatively impact our overall pricing. Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories. We may be required to invest more heavily to maintain and expand our product offerings. There can be no assurance that new product offerings will be widely accepted in the markets we serve. Significant negative developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.We own a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the United States, Canada, Europe, and other countries where product sales are possible. However, we have not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property for all products in all countries. The decision not to obtain patent and trademark protection in other countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon our proprietary intellectual property. This could impede growth into new markets where we do not have such protections and result in a greater supply of similar products in such markets, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue.Our success is in part dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our management information and communications systems.We are currently working through an enterprise resource program (“ERP”) system transition. Certain divisions of our Company migrated into the new ERP system during 2016 while certain other divisions may be transitioned during 2019 and subsequent years. The system implementation is intended to enable us to better meet the information requirements of our users, increase our integration efficiencies, and identify additional synergies in the future. The implementation of our ERP system is complex because of the wide range of processes and systems to be integrated across our business. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, operation, or implementation of our various systems, or in the performance of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business, including our ability to receive, process, ship, and bill for orders in a timely manner or our ability to properly manage our inventory or accurately present our inventory availability or pricing. Project delays, business interruptions, or loss of expected benefits could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and other parties, including financial information, intellectual property, and personal identification information. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability, and harm our reputation and business. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent current or rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including an intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Federal, state, and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information obtained from customers and individuals. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, such data privacy laws and regulations, including those of the European Union and the United Kingdom which are, in some respects, more stringent than U.S. standards, could be significant. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, legal and financial exposure, negative impacts on our customers’ willingness to transact business with us, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.We are dependent upon key customers.We could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers. A prolonged decrease in capital spending by our railroad customers could negatively impact our sales and profitability. No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a current customer, or customers, or potential litigation with a current customer, would not also impact our future results of operations and/or financial condition.10Table of ContentsAn adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation or pending or future warranty claims against the Company or its subsidiaries or our determination that a customer has a substantial product warranty claim could negatively impact our financial results and/or our financial condition.We are party to various legal proceedings. In addition, from time to time our customers assert claims against us relating to the warranties which apply to products we sell. There is the potential that a result materially adverse to us or our subsidiaries in pending or future legal proceedings or pending or future product warranty claims could materially exceed any accruals we have established and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition. In addition, we could suffer a significant loss of business from a customer who is dissatisfied with the resolution of a warranty claim.A portion of our sales are derived from our international operations, which expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.Doing business outside the United States subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts, and unexpected changes in United States and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments, and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign countries, including Canada, China, Mexico, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and countries within the European Union (“E.U.”), exposes the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, unable to alter our business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets. Fluctuations in the relative values of the United States dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro may result in volatile earnings to reflect exchange rate translation in our Canadian and European sales and operations. If the United States dollar strengthens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro, our reported earnings in dollars from sales in those currencies will be unfavorable. Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the United States dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro.Economic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom’s pending exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.In June 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K. government has initiated a process to withdraw from the E.U. and is negotiating the terms of its separation. There is also the chance of what is being called a “no-deal Brexit,” where no formal agreement is made between the U.K. and E.U. regarding the terms of separation prior to the U.K.'s exit from the E.U. Since the announcement of Brexit and, most recently, possible no-deal Brexit, there has been volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar relative to the U.K. pound, which could continue. The announcement of Brexit and pending withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. has also created market volatility and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, political institutions, and regulatory agencies.The majority of our U.K. operations are heavily concentrated within the U.K. borders; however, this could adversely affect the future growth of our U.K. operations into other European locations. Our U.K. operations represented approximately 11% and 10% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, less than 1% of our consolidated net revenue was from U.K. operation's sales exported to E.U. members other than the U.K.Material modification to the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) and certain other international trade agreements could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The current Presidential administration has made comments suggesting it is not supportive of certain international trade agreements, including the NAFTA. On November 30, 2018, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) was signed by the parties, but a renegotiation of NAFTA remains to be ratified by U.S. Congress. At this time, it remains unclear what the current administration and Congress would or would not do with respect to these international trade agreements. While the Company is a net exporter out of the United States, potential material modifications to NAFTA, or certain other international trade agreements, including USMCA, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Violations of foreign governmental regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers, or both and could have a material and adverse effect on our business.Our foreign operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate as well as U.S. laws. These include regulations relating to currency conversion, repatriation of earnings, taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel, and the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers, including, in some jurisdictions, mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar other worldwide anti-corruption laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, prohibit improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have established an internal control structure, corporate policies, compliance, and training processes to reduce the risk of violation, we cannot ensure that these procedures protect us from violations of such policies by our employees or agents. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could11Table of Contents subject us to fines, penalties, and suspension or debarment from contracting. Events of non-compliance could harm our reputation, reduce our revenues and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Violations of such laws or allegations of violation could disrupt our business and result in material adverse results to our operating results or future profitability.Certain divisions of our business depend on a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such supplier could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.In our Rail Products business unit, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers.

Approximately 139 employees employed at these facilities are currently working under three separate collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to renegotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a disruption of our operations and have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Actions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.In February 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with an activist investor, Legion Partners Asset Management, LLC and various of its affiliates (collectively, “Legion Partners”) that had filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC with respect to the Company. Pursuant to that agreement, the Company agreed to appoint a representative of Legion Partners to the Company’s Board of Directors and Legion Partners agreed to various standstill provisions and to vote for the Company’s director nominees at the Company’s 2016 and 2017 Annual Meetings of Shareholders. This agreement expired by its terms on February 13, 2018.Although our agreement with Legion Partners expired, activist investors may attempt to effect changes in the Company’s strategic direction and how the Company is governed, or to acquire control over the Company. Some investors seek to increase short-term shareholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. While the Company welcomes varying opinions from all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of the Company’s board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies.

RISK FACTORSRisks and UncertaintiesWe operate in a changing environment that involves numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The following risks highlight some of the more significant factors that have affected us and could affect us in the future. We may also be affected by unknown risks or risks that we currently believe are immaterial. If any such events actually occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before deciding to invest in our common stock.Our inability to successfully manage joint ventures, divestitures, and other significant transactions could harm our financial results, business, and prospects.As part of our business strategy, we may divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, and make investments to realize anticipated benefits, which actions involve a number of inherent risks and uncertainties. We can give no assurances that the opportunities will be consummated or that financing will be available. We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from strategic transactions as successfully or rapidly as projected, if at all.Our future performance and market value could cause additional write-downs of long-lived and intangible assets in future periods.We are required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles to review intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered to be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and resulting market capitalization, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. No impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets were recorded in 2017.During the third quarter of 2015, we performed an interim goodwill test and concluded that the carrying amounts of the Test and Inspection Services and Precision Measurement Systems business units’ goodwill exceeded the implied fair values of that goodwill. We recognized an aggregate non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $80,337 to write down the carrying values to the implied fair values, of which $69,908 represented the full carrying value of the goodwill related to the Test and Inspection Services business unit and the remaining $10,429 related to the Precision Measurement Systems business unit.During the second and third quarters of 2016, we performed an interim goodwill test and concluded that the carrying amounts of the Rail Technologies, Protective Coatings, and Precision Measurement Systems business units’ goodwill exceeded the implied fair values of the respective goodwill. We recognized an aggregate non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $61,142 to write down the carrying values to the implied fair values, of which $16,560 represented the full carrying value of goodwill related to the 2013 Ball Winch acquisition and $11,873 represented the remaining carrying value related to the Precision Measurement Systems business unit. We also performed interim long-lived asset recoverability tests during the second and third quarters of 2016 and concluded that the long-lived assets related to the Test and Inspection Services and Precision Measurement Systems business units had carrying values in excess of the asset groups’ fair value. We recognized non-cash definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $59,786 to write down the carrying values to the implied fair values, of which $42,982 related to Test and Inspection Services and $16,804 related to Precision Measurement Systems. Finally, in 2016, we recognized $14,956 non-cash tangible long-lived impairment charges related to the carrying value of certain long-lived tangible assets exceeding their fair value, all of which related to Test and Inspection Services.No assurances can be given that we will not be required to record future significant charges related to tangible or intangible asset impairments.Our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.Our indebtedness could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, it could:•require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows to payments of our indebtedness, which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, and other general corporate purposes;•limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and•limit, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate purposes.9Table of ContentsOur inability to comply with covenants in place or our inability to make the required principal and interest payments may cause an event of default, which could have a substantial adverse impact to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. There is no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions could be effected on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all, particularly if credit market conditions deteriorate. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that refinancings or asset dispositions would be permitted by the terms of our credit agreements or debt instruments. Our existing credit agreements contain, and any future debt agreements we may enter into may contain, certain financial tests and other covenants that limit our ability to incur indebtedness, acquire other businesses, and may impose various other restrictions. Our ability to comply with financial tests may be adversely affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control, and these covenants may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. We cannot be certain that we will be able to comply with the financial tests and other covenants, or, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers or amended terms from our lenders. An uncured default with respect to one or more of the covenants could result in the amounts outstanding being declared immediately due and payable, which may also trigger an obligation to redeem our outstanding debt securities and repay all other outstanding indebtedness. Any such acceleration of our indebtedness would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Prolonged low energy prices and other unfavorable changes in U.S., global, or regional economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.We could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative changes in economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers as well as the capital markets. Negative changes in government spending may result in delayed or permanent deferrals of existing or potential projects. No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer orders and payments, and access to available capital resources outside of operations.In addition, volatile market conditions and low energy prices could continue for an extended period, which would negatively affect our business prospects. Historically, oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty, and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Sustained declines or significant and frequent fluctuations in the price of oil and natural gas may have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.Our ability to maintain or improve our profitability could be adversely impacted by cost pressures.Our profitability is dependent upon the efficient use of our resources. Rising inflation, labor costs, labor disruptions, and other increases in costs in the geographic areas in which we operate could have a significant adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.Management projections, estimates, and judgments may not be indicative of our future performance.Our management is required to use certain estimates in preparing our financial statements, including accounting estimates to determine reserves related to litigation, deferred tax assets, and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities. Certain asset and liability valuations are subject to management’s judgment and actual results are influenced by factors outside our control.We are required to maintain a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and record a charge to income and equity if we determine, based on available evidence at the time the determination is made, that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This evaluation process involves significant management judgment about assumptions that are subject to change from period to period. The use of different estimates can result in changes in the amounts of deferred tax items recognized, which can result in equity and earnings volatility because such changes are reported in current period earnings. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 14 Income Taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for additional discussion of our deferred taxes.Our business operates in highly competitive markets and a failure to react to changing market conditions could adversely impact our business.We face strong competition in each of the markets in which we participate. A slow response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines could negatively impact our overall pricing. Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories. We may be required to invest more heavily to maintain and expand our product offerings. There can be no assurance that new product offerings will be widely accepted in the markets we serve. Significant negative developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.10Table of ContentsIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.We own a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the United States, Canada, Europe, and other countries where product sales are possible. However, we have not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property for all products in all countries. The decision not to obtain patent and trademark protection in other countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon our proprietary intellectual property. This could impede growth into new markets where we do not have such protections and result in a greater supply of similar products in such markets, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue.Our success is in part dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our management information and communications systems.We are currently working through an enterprise resource program (“ERP”) system transition. Certain divisions of our Company migrated into the new ERP system during 2016 while certain other divisions may be transitioned during 2018 and subsequent years. The system implementation is intended to enable us to better meet the information requirements of our users, increase our integration efficiencies, and identify additional synergies in the future. The implementation of our ERP system is complex because of the wide range of processes and systems to be integrated across our business. Project delays, business interruptions, or loss of expected benefits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the design, operation, or implementation of our various systems, or in the performance of our systems, particularly any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies that impact our operations, could adversely affect our ability to effectively run and manage our business, including our ability to receive, process, ship, and bill for orders in a timely manner or our ability to properly manage our inventory or accurately present our inventory availability or pricing.We are subject to cybersecurity risks and may incur increasing costs in an effort to minimize those risks.Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the storage and transmission of proprietary or confidential information regarding our customers, employees, job applicants, and other parties, including financial information, intellectual property, and personal identification information. Security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information, expose us to liability, and harm our reputation and business. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful. We may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent current or rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including an intentional or inadvertent breach by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Any compromise or breach of our security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws, legal and financial exposure, negative impacts on our customers’ willingness to transact business with us, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation.We are dependent upon key customers.We could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers. A prolonged decrease in capital spending by our railroad customers could negatively impact our sales and profitability. As a result of the ongoing litigation and termination of the amended 2005 concrete tie supply agreement with Union Pacific Railroad (“UPRR”), our CXT Concrete Tie sales to, and new orders from, UPRR have ceased which adversely affected our results beginning in 2015.No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a current customer, or customers, or potential litigation with a current customer, would not also impact our results of operations and/or financial condition.An adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation or pending or future warranty claims against the Company or its subsidiaries or our determination that a customer has a substantial product warranty claim could negatively impact our financial results and/or our financial condition.We are party to various legal proceedings. In addition, from time to time our customers assert claims against us relating to the warranties which apply to products we sell. There is the potential that a result materially adverse to us or our subsidiaries in pending or future legal proceedings or pending or future product warranty claims could materially exceed any accruals we have established and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition. In addition, we could suffer a significant loss of business from a customer who is dissatisfied with the resolution of a warranty claim. For example, UPRR terminated our amended 2005 concrete tie supply agreement over allegedly defective ties and reduced new orders for other products which negatively affected our results beginning in 2015.11Table of ContentsIn January 2015, UPRR filed a lawsuit against the Company asserting that we were in material breach of our amended 2005 concrete tie supply agreement with UPRR due to claimed failures to provide warranty ties to replace alleged defective concrete ties. UPRR seeks various types of relief including incidental, consequential, and other damages in amounts to be determined at trial under various legal theories. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 19 Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for additional information regarding UPRR’s lawsuit.We continue to work with UPRR in an attempt to reach a resolution on this matter. However, such discussions may not be successful, and the results of litigation and any settlement or judgment amounts resulting from this matter may not be within the range of our estimated accrual. Consequently, while we believe the claims in the UPRR lawsuit are without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves and have asserted a counterclaim for damages in the UPRR lawsuit, an adverse outcome could result in a substantial judgment against us that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and capital resources. No assurances can be given that prior to any settlement or judgment, we will not recognize additional material charges because our warranty reserve accrual for UPRR is based upon our current estimate of the number of defective concrete ties that need to be replaced and facts could emerge which would cause us to materially increase this estimate.A portion of our sales are derived from our international operations, which expose us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.Doing business outside the United States subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts, and unexpected changes in United States and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments, and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign countries exposes the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, unable to alter our business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products or increase our labor or supply costs in non-U.S. markets. Fluctuations in the relative values of the United States dollar, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Euro may result in volatile earnings to reflect exchange rate translation in our Canadian and European sales and operations. If the United States dollar strengthens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro, our reported earnings in dollars from sales in those currencies will be unfavorable. Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the United States dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar, British pound, or Euro.Economic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom’s pending exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.In June 2016, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. government has initiated a process to withdraw from the E.U. and has begun negotiating the terms of its separation. Since the announcement of Brexit, there has been volatility in currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. dollar relative to the U.K. pound. The announcement of Brexit and pending withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. may also create market volatility and could continue to contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, political institutions, and regulatory agencies. The majority of our U.K. operations are heavily concentrated within the U.K. borders; however, this could adversely affect the future growth of our U.K. operations into other European locations. Our U.K. operations represented approximately 10% of our total revenue for the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.Material modification to NAFTA and certain other international trade agreements could affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The current Presidential administration has made comments suggesting it is not supportive of certain international trade agreements, including the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”). At this time, it remains unclear what the current administration and Congress would or would not do with respect to these international trade agreements. While the Company is a net exporter out of the United States, potential material modifications to NAFTA, or certain other international trade agreements, may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.12Table of ContentsViolations of foreign governmental regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-corruption laws, could result in fines, penalties, and criminal sanctions against the Company, its officers, or both and could adversely affect our business.Our foreign operations are subject to governmental regulations in the countries in which we operate as well as U.S. laws. These include regulations relating to currency conversion, repatriation of earnings, taxation of our earnings and the earnings of our personnel, and the increasing requirement in some countries to make greater use of local employees and suppliers, including, in some jurisdictions, mandates that provide for greater local participation in the ownership and control of certain local business assets.The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar other worldwide anti-corruption laws, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, prohibit improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Although we have established an internal control structure, corporate policies, compliance, and training processes to reduce the risk of violation, we cannot ensure that these procedures protect us from violations of such policies by our employees or agents. Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations could subject us to fines, penalties, and suspension or debarment from contracting. Events of non-compliance could harm our reputation, reduce our revenues and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions. Violations of such laws or allegations of violation could disrupt our business and result in material adverse results to our operating results or future profitability.Certain divisions of our business depend on a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and result of operations.In our Rail Products businesses, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers. In addition, our Piling business is predominantly dependent upon one supplier for sheet piling while our Protective Coatings business is predominately dependent on two suppliers of epoxy coating. A significant downturn in the business of one or more of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us, or a disruption in the availability of existing and new piling and rail products may adversely impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price, quality, and availability of the primary raw materials used in our business could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Most of our businesses utilize steel as a significant product component. The steel industry is cyclical and prices and availability are subject to these cycles as well as to international market forces. We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our CXT Concrete Ties and Precast Concrete Products businesses. No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.Labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Four of our manufacturing facilities are staffed by employees represented by labor unions. Approximately 146 employees employed at these facilities are currently working under three separate collective bargaining agreements. Disputes with regard to the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to renegotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.Actions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.In February 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with an activist investor, Legion Partners Asset Management, LLC and various of its affiliates (collectively, “Legion Partners”) that had filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC with respect to the Company. Pursuant to that agreement, the Company agreed to appoint a representative of Legion Partners to the Company’s Board of Directors and Legion Partners agreed to various standstill provisions and to vote for the Company’s director nominees at the Company’s 2016 and 2017 Annual Meetings of Shareholders. This agreement expired by its terms on February 13, 2018.13Table of ContentsAlthough our agreement with Legion Partners expired by its terms in February 2017, activist investors may attempt to effect changes in the Company’s strategic direction and how the Company is governed, or to acquire control over the Company. Some investors seek to increase short-term shareholder value by advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases, or even sales of assets or the entire company. While the Company welcomes varying opinions from all shareholders, activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time-consuming, and divert the attention of the Company’s board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. In addition, perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of changes to the composition of our Board may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business, instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, may cause concern to our current or potential customers, may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners. These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.Our success is highly dependent on the continued service and availability of qualified personnel.Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, the executive team, and other highly skilled employees. Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel could negatively affect our ability to compete and lead to a reduction in our profitability.We may not foresee or be able to control certain events that could adversely affect our business.Unexpected events including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters, armed conflicts, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or a disruption in certain of our operations, may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise impact our financial performance.Shifting federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory policies impose risks to our operations.We are subject to regulation by federal, state, local, and foreign regulatory agencies. We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous authorizations, permits, approvals, and certificates from governmental agencies. Compliance with emerging regulatory initiatives, delays, discontinuations, or reversals of existing regulatory policies in the markets in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on previously deferred earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries, and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. Our 2017 financial results include a provisional tax expense of $3,298 related to the one-time transition tax, partially offset by a provisional $1,508 tax benefit related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. We will continue to refine our provisional tax amounts during 2018, as we gain a more thorough understanding of the tax law, as further guidance is issued, and as we evaluate our income tax accounting policies with regard to certain provisions of the Act.A substantial portion of our operations are heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects. Many of these projects have “Buy America” or “Buy American” provisions. Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results. Additionally, government actions concerning “Buy America” provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results"

Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the United States dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar or British pound.Our business operates in a highly competitive industry.We face strong competition in all of the markets in which we participate.  Our response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines, could negatively impact our overall pricing in the marketplace.  Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories.  Significant negative developments in these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.  9Table of Contents If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.The Company owns a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. These patent protections begin expiring in 2014. However, the Company has not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property in other countries. The failure to obtain patent and trademark protection in other countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon the Company’s proprietary intellectual property. This could impede growth into new markets where the Company does not have such protections and result in greater supplies of similar products, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue.We are dependent upon key customers.The Company could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers.  A significant decrease in capital spending by our railroad customers could negatively impact our product revenue.  No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a customer, or customers, would not impact our results of operations and/or financial condition.In July 2011 the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) notified the Company and its CXT subsidiary of a warranty claim under CXT's 2005 supply contract relating to the sale of prestressed concrete railroad ties for the UPRR.  Based on the non-specific nature of the UPRR’s assertion and the Company’s current inability to verify the claims, the Company is unable to determine a range of reasonably possible outcomes regarding this potential exposure matter. As a result, no accruals were made as a result of this claim as the impact, if any, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. No assurances can be given regarding the ultimate outcome of this matter.  The ultimate resolution of this matter could have a material, adverse impact on our financial statements, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources.The Company’s CXT Rail operation and ARP division are dependent on the UPRR for a significant portion of their business.  The CXT Rail operation was awarded a long-term contract in 2005 from the UPRR for the supply of prestressed concrete railroad ties.  CXT Rail completed construction of a new facility in Tucson, AZ in 2006 to accommodate the contract’s requirements.  UPRR has agreed to purchase minimum annual quantities from the Tucson, AZ facility through December 2012.  In December 2010, the UPRR opted not to extend the supply agreement for the Grand Island, NE plant and we closed the plant in February 2012.  No assurances can be given on whether the existing UPRR product warranty claim will adversely impact the Company’s ability to extend the supply agreement with the Tucson, AZ facility.A substantial portion of our operations are heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects.  Many of these projects have “Buy America” or “Buy American” provisions.  Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results.  Additionally, government actions concerning “Buy America” provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results.A growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.The Company is placing increased emphasis on the expansion of our international sales opportunities. Doing business outside the United States subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic, climate and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts and unexpected changes in United States and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign countries will expose the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. The Company has little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, unable to alter its business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.  10Table of Contents Certain segments of our business depend on a small number of suppliers.  The loss of any such supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations.In our rail and piling distributed products businesses, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers.  No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business of one of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us or a disruption in the availability of existing and new piling and rail products would not adversely impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price, quality and availability of our primary raw materials used in our business could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Most of Foster’s businesses utilize steel as a significant product component.  The steel industry is cyclical and prices and availability are subject to these cycles as well as to international market forces.  We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our concrete railroad tie and our precast concrete building businesses.  Cement and aggregate prices are subject to market conditions but this has not yet had a significant impact on the Company.  No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.Our joint venture may require us to meet future capital commitments that may be burdensome or have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.We have a joint venture with L B Industries, Inc. and another party to manufacture, market and sell various products for the energy, utility and construction markets.  In connection with the joint venture agreement, we were required to make capital contributions of $3.0 million, which the Company met in 2011.  No assurances can be given that additional capital contributions will not be required or that the joint venture will perform in accordance with our expectations.Labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Four of the Company’s manufacturing facilities are staffed by employees represented by labor unions.  These approximately 190 employees are currently working under three separate collective bargaining agreements.In September 2011, we negotiated the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement with our Spokane, WA workforce represented by the United Steelworkers Local Number 338.  This agreement, covering approximately 100 employees, expires in September 2014.In October 2010, we negotiated the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement with our Bedford, PA workforce represented by the Shopman’s Local Union Number 527.  This agreement, covering approximately 70 employees, expires in March 2014.The collective bargaining agreement with our St. Jean, Quebec, Canada workforce is represented by the Canadian Steel Workers Union Local Number 9443.  This agreement, covering approximately 20 employees, expires in August 2013.These collective bargaining agreements forbid the respective labor organizations from endorsing any work stoppage during the life of the agreements.An adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation could negatively impact our operations and profitability.Changes in our expectations of the outcome of certain legal actions could vary materially from our current expectations and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition.  11Table of Contents Future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affecting the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs.In February 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission published guidance regarding its existing disclosure requirements as they apply to climate change matters.  A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change including pending U.S. legislation that, if enacted, would limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, among other provisions.  In addition, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has for the first time required large emitters of greenhouse gases to collect and report data with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions.  Assessments of the potential impact, both positive or negative, of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given that these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact our operations directly or indirectly through our suppliers or customers.Our future performance and market value could cause future write-downs of intangible assets in future periods.The Company is required under generally accepted accounting principles to review its intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered to be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the Company’s intangible assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. No assurances can be given that the Company will not be required to record a significant, adverse charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or intangible assets occurs.We may not foresee or be able to control certain events that could adversely affect our business.Unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities, natural disasters, war, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or a disruption in certain of our operations may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise impact our financial performance"
6,FSTR,FOSTER (LB) CO,2011-03-16,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSRisks and UncertaintiesWe intend to pursue acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances that involve a number of inherent risks, any of which may cause us not to realize anticipated benefits.We continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that have the potential to support and strengthen our business.  We can give no assurances that any opportunities will arise or if they do, that they will be consummated or that potential additional financing will be available.  In addition, acquisitions involve inherent risks that the acquired business will not perform in accordance with our expectations.  We may not be able to achieve the synergies and other benefits we expect from the integration as successfully or rapidly as projected, if at all.  Our failure to integrate newly acquired operations could prevent us from realizing our expected rate of return on an acquired business and could have a material or adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.The integration of our recently completed acquisitions could result in the loss of key employees or other workforce disruptions that may have a material adverse effect on our operations or profitability.It is possible that the Portec merger could result in the loss of key employees, result in the disruption of one or more of its ongoing businesses or identify inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect one or more of its operations’ ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers or creditors.  Employee retention before, during or after the combination may be challenging as employees may experience uncertainty about future roles until strategies with regard to the combined company are announced or executed.Prolonged unfavorable economic and market conditions could adversely affect our business.We could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative changes in economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers as well as the capital markets.  No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer payments and access to available capital resources outside of operations.We may incur increased costs due to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.The majority of the Company’s products and services are sold in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.  Fluctuations in the relative values of the United States dollar, Canadian dollar and British pound will require adjustments in reported earnings and operations to reflect exchange rate translation in the Company’s Canadian and United Kingdom sales and operations.  If the United States dollar strengthens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar or British pound, the Company’s reported earnings in dollars from sales in those currencies will be unfavorable. Conversely, a favorable result will be reported if the United States dollar weakens in value as compared to the value of the Canadian dollar or British pound.Our business operates in a highly competitive industry.We face strong competition in all of the markets in which we participate.  Our response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines, could negatively impact our overall pricing in the marketplace.  Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories.  Significant negative developments in these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property and prevent its improper use by third parties, our ability to compete may be harmed.The Company owns a number of patents and trademarks under the intellectual property laws of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. These patent protections begin expiring in 2014. However, the Company has not perfected patent and trademark protection of our proprietary intellectual property in other countries. The failure to obtain patent and trademark protection in other countries may result in other companies copying and marketing products that are based upon the Company’s proprietary intellectual property. This could impede growth into new markets where the Company does not have such protections and result in greater supplies of similar products, which in turn could result in a loss of pricing power and reduced revenue.  9Table of Contents We are dependent upon key customers.Foster could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers.  No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a customer, or customers, would not impact our results of operations and /or financial condition.A significant decrease in capital spending by our railroad customers could negatively impact our product revenue.  The Company’s CXT Rail operation and ARP division are dependent on the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) for a significant portion of their business.  The CXT Rail operation was awarded a long-term contract in 2005 from the UPRR for the supply of prestressed concrete railroad ties.  CXT Rail expanded and modernized its Grand Island, NE plant in 2005, and completed construction of a new facility in Tucson, AZ in 2006 to accommodate the contract’s requirements.  UPRR has agreed to purchase minimum annual quantities from the Tucson, AZ facility through December 2012.  In December 2010, the UPRR opted not to extend the supply agreement for the Grand Island, NE plant.A substantial portion of our operations are heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects.  Many of these projects have “Buy America” or “Buy American” provisions.  Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results.  Additionally, government actions concerning “Buy America” provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results.A growing portion of our sales may be derived from our international operations, which exposes us to certain risks inherent in doing business on an international level.Historically, substantially all of the Company’s business has been conducted in the United States.  With the Company’s acquisition of Portec, the Company will be expanding into international markets, primarily Canada and the United Kingdom.  Additionally, the Company is placing increased emphasis on the expansion of our international sales opportunities. Doing business outside the United States subjects the Company to various risks, including changing economic, climate and political conditions, work stoppages, exchange controls, currency fluctuations, armed conflicts and unexpected changes in United States and foreign laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, transportation regulations, foreign investments and taxation. Increasing sales to foreign countries will expose the Company to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. The Company has little control over most of these risks and may be unable to anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions and, therefore, unable to alter its business practices in time to avoid the adverse effect of any of these possible changes.Certain segments of our business depend on a small number of suppliers, the loss of any such supplier could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result of operations.In our rail and piling distributed products businesses, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers.  No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business of one of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us or a disruption in the availability of existing and new piling and rail products would not adversely impact our financial results.Fluctuations in the price, quality and availability of our primary raw materials used in our business could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Most of Foster’s businesses utilize steel as a significant product component.  The steel industry is cyclical and prices and availability are subject to these cycles as well as to international market forces.  We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our concrete railroad tie and our precast concrete building businesses.  Cement and aggregate prices are subject to market conditions but this has not yet had a significant impact on the Company.  No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.  10Table of Contents Our joint venture may require us to meet future capital commitments that may be burdensome or have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.We have a joint venture with L B Industries, Inc. and another party to manufacture, market and sell various products for the energy, utility and construction markets.  In connection with the joint venture agreement, we were required to make capital contributions of $2.2 million, which the Company met in 2010.  No assurances can be given that additional capital contributions will not be required or that the joint venture will perform in accordance with our expectations.Labor disputes may have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability.Four of the Company’s manufacturing facilities are staffed by employees represented by labor unions.  These 163 employees are currently working under three separate collective bargaining agreements.In October 2007, we negotiated the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement with our Spokane, WA workforce represented by the United Steelworkers Local Number 338.  This agreement, covering approximately 80 employees, expires in September 2011.In October 2010, we negotiated the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement with our Bedford, PA workforce represented by the Shopman’s Local Union Number 527.  This agreement, covering approximately 50 employees, expires in March 2014.The collective bargaining agreement with our St. Jean, Quebec, Canada workforce is represented by the Canadian Steel Workers Union Local Number 9443.  This agreement, covering approximately 30 employees, expires in August 2013.The existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a work stoppage at L. B. Foster’s facilities.An adverse outcome in any pending or future litigation could negatively impact our operations and profitability.Changes in our expectations of the outcome of certain legal actions could vary materially from our current expectations and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition.We may not be able to collect future contingent payments in connection with the sale of our investment in DM&E.As part of the 2007 sale of our investment in the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad (DM&E) to the Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP), we received the right to future contingent payments based on (i) construction commencing on the Powder River Basin Expansion Project (PRB) and (ii) certain PRB tonnage thresholds being surpassed.  The CP is obligated to pay the DM&E’s former equity holders an aggregate of $350.0 million, plus interest at 5% per annum, if the CP commences construction of the PRB expansion prior to December 31, 2025.  Additionally, CP shall cause the former equity holders to receive certain payments not to exceed $707.0 million if the CP attains milestones, as set forth in the sales agreement, related to PRB coal tonnage thresholds prior to December 31, 2025.Our share of any of this construction milestone payment or individual future coal milestone payments, if any such payments are made, prior to expenses and any offsets, is approximately 12¼%.  No assurances can be given that any of these payments will be made and the Company does not know whether the CP will construct the PRB expansion.  11Table of Contents Future climate change regulation could result in increased operating costs, affecting the demand for our products or affect the ability of our critical suppliers to meet our needs.In February 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission published guidance regarding its existing disclosure requirements as they apply to climate change matters.  A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change including pending U.S. legislation that, if enacted, would limit and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits, among other provisions.  In addition, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency has for the first time required large emitters of greenhouse gases to collect and report data with respect to their greenhouse gas emissions.  Assessments of the potential impact, both positive or negative, of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given that these regulatory mechanisms may be either voluntary or legislated and may impact our operations directly or indirectly through our suppliers or customers.Our future performance and market value could cause future write-downs of intangible assets in future periods.The Company is required under generally accepted accounting principles to review its intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered to be a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of the Company’s intangible assets may not be recoverable include, but are not limited to, a decline in stock price and market capitalization, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or a significant decrease in operating or cash flow projections. No assurances can be given that the Company will not be required to record a significant, adverse charge to earnings during the period in which any impairment of its goodwill or intangible assets occurs.We may not foresee or be able to control certain events that could adversely affect our business.Unexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities, natural disasters, war, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or a disruption in certain of our operations may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise impact our financial performance"

Foster Company, a Pennsylvania corporation (“L.B. Foster”), Foster Thomas Company, a West Virginia corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of L.B. Foster (“Purchaser”), and Portec Rail Products, Inc., a West Virginia corporation (“Portec” or the “Company”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”).  Should the merger not be consummated, we would continue with our above acquisition growth strategy.  More information regarding the merger can be found in the “Recent Developments” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following two risk factors relate to the proposed merger.Merger Agreement ConsummationThe consummation of the Merger Agreement with Portec is subject to various conditions including the acceptance of the tender offer by at least 65% of the Shareholders of Portec, the absence of legal prohibitions and the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals to the extent they relate to antitrust and competition laws, including the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.  Consummation of the merger is not subject to a financing condition.Loss of Key Employees or Customers or Otherwise Cause Business Disruption resulting from MergerUntil completion of the Merger Agreement, we and Portec have operated and will continue to operate independently.  It is possible that the merger could result in the loss of key employees, result in the disruption of one or more of the companies’ ongoing businesses or identify inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect one or more of the companies’ ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers or creditors.  Employee retention before, during or after the combination may be challenging as employees may experience uncertainty about future roles until strategies with regard to the combined company are announced or executed.General Economic ConditionsWe could be adversely impacted by prolonged negative changes in economic conditions affecting either our suppliers or customers as well as the capital markets.  No assurances can be given that we will be able to successfully mitigate various prolonged uncertainties including materials cost variability, delayed or reduced customer payments and access to available capital resources outside of operations.Markets and CompetitionWe face strong competition in all of the markets in which we participate.  Our response to competitor pricing actions and new competitor entries into our product lines, could negatively impact our overall pricing in the marketplace.  Efforts to improve pricing could negatively impact our sales volume in all product categories.  Significant negative developments in these areas could adversely affect our financial results and condition.Customer RelianceFoster could be adversely affected by changes in the business or financial condition of a customer or customers.  No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business or financial condition of a customer, or customers, would not impact our results of operations and /or financial condition.A significant decrease in capital spending by our railroad customers could negatively impact our product revenue.  The Company’s CXT Rail operation and Allegheny Rail Products division are dependent on the Union Pacific Railroad (UPRR) for a significant portion of their business.  The CXT Rail operation was awarded a long-term contract in 2005 from the UPRR for the supply of prestressed concrete railroad ties.  CXT Rail expanded and modernized its Grand Island, NE plant in 2005, and completed construction of a new facility in Tucson, AZ in 2006 to accommodate the contract’s requirements.  UPRR has agreed to purchase minimum annual quantities from the Grand Island, NE facility through December 2010, and the Tucson, AZ facility through December 2012.  8Table of ContentsA substantial portion of our operations are heavily dependent on governmental funding of infrastructure projects.  Many of these projects have “Buy America” or “Buy American” provisions.  Significant changes in the level of government funding of these projects could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our operating results.  Additionally, government actions concerning “Buy America” provisions, taxation, tariffs, the environment, or other matters could impact our operating results.Supplier RelianceIn our rail and piling distributed products businesses, we rely on one or two suppliers for key products that we sell to our customers.  No assurances can be given that a significant downturn in the business of one of these suppliers, a disruption in their manufacturing operations, an unwillingness to continue to sell to us or a disruption in the availability of existing and new piling and rail products would not adversely impact our financial results.Raw Material Costs and AvailabilityMost of Foster’s businesses utilize steel as a significant product component.  The steel industry is cyclical and prices as well as availability are subject to international market forces.  We also use significant amounts of cement and aggregate in our concrete railroad tie and our precast concrete building businesses.  Cement and aggregate prices are subject to market conditions but this has not yet had a significant impact on the Company.  No assurances can be given that our financial results would not be adversely affected if prices or availability of these materials were to change in a significantly unfavorable manner.Joint VentureWe have a joint venture with L B Industries, Inc. and another party to manufacture, market and sell various products for the energy, utility and construction markets.  In connection with the joint venture agreement, we are required to make initial capital contributions of $1.9 million of which there remains approximately $0.5 million at December 31, 2009.  No assurances can be given that additional capital contributions will not be required or that the joint venture will perform in accordance with our expectations.Union Workforce and Labor RelationsThree of the Company’s manufacturing facilities are staffed by employees represented by labor unions.  These 134 employees are currently working under two separate collective bargaining agreements.In October 2007, we negotiated the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement with our Spokane, WA workforce represented by the United Steelworkers Local Number 338.  This agreement, covering approximately 90 employees, expires in September 2011.In March 2008, we negotiated the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement with our Bedford, PA workforce represented by the Shopman’s Local Union Number 527.  This agreement, covering approximately 40 employees, expires in March 2011.The existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a work stoppage at L. B. Foster’s facilities.Legal ContingenciesChanges in our expectations of the outcome of certain legal actions could vary materially from our current expectations and adversely affect our financial results and/or financial condition.  9Table of ContentsDM&E Contingent PaymentsAs part of the 2007 sale of our investment in the Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad (DM&E) to the Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (CP), we received the right to future contingent payments based on (i) construction commencing on the Powder River Basin Expansion Project (PRB) and (ii) certain PRB tonnage thresholds being surpassed.  The CP is obligated to pay the DM&E’s former equity holders an aggregate of $350.0 million, plus interest at 5% per annum, if the CP commences construction of the PRB expansion prior to December 31, 2025.  Additionally, CP shall cause the former equity holders to receive certain payments not to exceed $707.0 million if the CP attains milestones, as set forth in the sales agreement, related to PRB coal tonnage thresholds prior to December 31, 2025.Our share of any of this construction milestone payment or individual future coal milestone payments, if any such payments are made, prior to expenses and any offsets, is approximately 12¼%.  No assurances can be given that any of these payments will be made and the CP has stated that it may take several years for it to determine whether to construct the PRB expansion.  For more information regarding the sale of our investment in the DM&E, please see our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007.Unexpected EventsUnexpected events including fires or explosions at facilities, natural disasters, war, unplanned outages, equipment failures, failure to meet product specifications, or a disruption in certain of our operations may cause our operating costs to increase or otherwise impact our financial performance"
