3,TILE,INTERFACE INC,2024-02-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock. Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.Risk Factors
 Related to our Business and OperationsWe compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do. We may face challenges competing on price, making investments in our business, or competing on product design or sustainability. The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. In prior years, some of our competitors were adding manufacturing capacity into the industry throughout the globe which increased the amount of supply in the market. Increased capacity at our competitors could result in pricing pressure on our products and less demand for our products, thus adversely affecting both revenues and profitability.  Some of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet and resilient flooring as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do. Competing effectively may require us to make additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network, and sales and marketing activities. In addition, we often compete on design preferences. Our customers’ design preferences may evolve or change before we adapt quickly enough to those changes or before we recognize those changes have happened in the marketplace. If this occurs, it could negatively affect our sales as our customers choose other product offerings that more closely align with their design preferences. Moreover, as our competitors improve the sustainability attributes of their products and operations, or if our competitors market the sustainability attributes of their products or operations more effectively than we do, it could negatively affect the degree to which we differentiate from our competitors on those attributes which could negatively affect our ability to compete and gain those sales as customers choose product offerings from our competitors instead of our product offerings. In situations such as these, we may be required by accounting rules to recognize a loss for the write-down of the value of our inventory due to its age or obsolescence.Our earnings could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, when a test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets.As prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period.We recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $36.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $121.3 million in the first quarter of 2020. The 2022 impairment charge was primarily a result of macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, rising interest rates and the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar causing a negative impact to our revenue and operating income in our EMEA goodwill reporting unit. The 2020 impairment charge was primarily a result of the expected duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its anticipated negative impact to our revenue and operating income. Future impairment charges could result if these macroeconomic conditions or other negative market events or conditions continue to impact our operations.12Table of ContentsOur success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives, our principal design consultant and other key personnel (including experienced sales and manufacturing personnel), and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our agreement with David Oakey Designs can be terminated by either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. Our business also depends on the recruitment and retention of other key personnel, including experienced sales and manufacturing personnel.The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience.  In certain locations where we operate, the demand for labor has exceeded the supply of labor, resulting in higher costs.  Despite our focused efforts to attract and retain employees, including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances, we experienced attrition rates within our hourly workforce in recent years, particularly in 2021, that exceeded historical levels and we incurred higher operating costs at certain of our facilities in the form of higher levels of overtime pay. The market for professional workers was, and remains, similarly challenging. Many of our professional workers continue to work part time or full time from home, initially as part of our COVID-19 protocols and more recently as part of our hybrid working arrangement policies. As a result, we may experience higher levels of attrition within our professional workforce in the future. We may lose the services of key personnel for a variety of reasons, including if our compensation programs become uncompetitive in the relevant markets for our employees and service providers, or if the Company undergoes significant disruptive change, including economic downturns. The loss of key personnel with a great deal of knowledge, training and experience — particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management — could have an adverse impact on our business. We may not be able to easily replace such personnel, particularly if the underlying reasons for the loss make the Company relatively unattractive as an employer.We continue to implement changes within our sales organization, including to the standardized processes and systems that our sales force uses to go to market, interact with customers, work with architects and the design community and, in general, operate day-to-day. We also continue to improve and change the technology tools that the sales force is required to use as part of their day-to-day jobs and monitor managerial positions that are designed to actively manage and coach the sales force. All of these changes are disruptive, which may create challenges for our sales force to adapt, particularly for long tenured employees. There are no guarantees that these efforts will increase sales or improve profitability of the business, or that they will not instead adversely disrupt the business, decrease sales, and decrease overall profitability. Large increases in the cost of our raw materials, shipping costs, duties or tariffs could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers. Petroleum-based products (including yarn) comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing carpet. Synthetic rubber uses petroleum-based products as feedstock as well. We also incur significant shipping and transport costs to move our products around the globe, and those costs have increased dramatically due to global supply chain, macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued inflation and volatility in the cost of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs could continue to adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such cost increases to our customers.13Table of ContentsUnanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber or our primary third-party supplier for luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) or other key raw materials could have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber and are largely dependent upon two primary suppliers for our LVT products. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon), our primary suppliers of LVT, or other key raw material suppliers, including failure by any third-party supplier to meet our product specifications, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products or our own LVT. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately or a shortfall in production by the supplier for reasons unrelated to us, such as work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. The primary manufacturing facility of our largest supplier of LVT is located in South Korea. If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber, our primary suppliers of LVT, or suppliers of other key raw materials are terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier or developing new supply chain sources for LVT. A prolonged inability on our part to source synthetic fiber included in our products, LVT, or other key raw materials on a cost-effective basis could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline. The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward. Changes to our facilities, manufacturing processes, product construction, and product composition could disrupt our operations, increase our manufacturing costs, increase customer complaints, increase warranty claims, negatively affect our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we make improvements and changes to our physical facilities, move operations to other sites, and change our manufacturing processes. In the first quarter of 2022, we permanently closed our carpet tile manufacturing facility in Thailand and transferred that production volume to other existing manufacturing operations in China and Australia. Large scale changes or moves could disrupt our normal operations, leading to possible loss of productivity, which may adversely affect our results. We are also making significant investments and modifications to our manufacturing facilities, processes, product compositions, and product construction including but not limited to the production of our CQuest™ carpet tile backings. These changes can be disruptive. There is also no guarantee that our CQuest™ backings will perform as expected and will not increase warranty claims or customer complaints. These efforts may also not yield the financial returns and improvements in the business that we hope to achieve from them. While these changes are intended to yield stronger financial results, they could potentially impact our financial results in negative ways due to project delays, business disruption as new facilities and equipment come online, increased customer complaints, or increased warranty claims; all of which could negatively affect our operations, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.  Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes, fire, adverse weather conditions, pandemics, endemics, unstable geopolitical situations or other unexpected events. While we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our manufacturing facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, storms, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, whether or not as a result of climate change, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions, acts of war, terrorism, protests, energy shortages and disruptions, pandemics or other public health crises or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customers’ facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These types of events could also affect our suppliers, installers, and customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 14Table of ContentsDisruptions to or failures of information technology systems we use could adversely affect our business. We rely heavily on information technology systems—both software and computer hardware—to operate our business. Some of these systems are owned and operated by us, and some are owned or operated by third parties pursuant to leases, licenses or other contracts with those third parties. We rely on these systems to, among other things:•facilitate and plan the purchase, management and distribution of, and payment for, inventory and raw materials;•control our production processes;•manage and monitor our distribution network and logistics;•receive, process and ship orders;•manage billing, collections, cash applications, customer service, and payables;•manage financial reporting; and•manage payroll and human resources information.The IT systems we use may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including:•natural disasters, like fires;•power loss;•software “bugs”, hardware defects or human error; and•hacking, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, malware, ransomware, phishing scams, compromised or irretrievable backups or other cyber-attacks.Any of these events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations. These disruptions may lead to production or shipping stoppages, which may in turn lead to material revenue loss and reputational harm.Despite security designs and internal controls, the IT systems we use have in the past experienced, and may in the future become subject to, attempts by unauthorized third parties to access and exfiltrate confidential information, manipulate data or disrupt our operations. In November 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity attack, perpetrated by unauthorized third parties, affecting our IT systems (the “Cyber Event”). In response, we promptly shut down certain systems, including shipping, inventory management and production systems, and engaged forensic experts to evaluate the extent of the Cyber Event and its disruption to our operations. The investigation of the Cyber Event by our forensic experts was completed during fiscal year 2023.In fiscal year 2022, in connection with the Cyber Event, our revenues were adversely affected by approximately $8 million due to lost sales. Additionally, we incurred Cyber Event costs of approximately $5 million in fiscal year 2022 primarily due to idle plant costs, direct labor costs during the period our manufacturing facilities were idle and third-party remediation costs. We have insurance and anticipate that a portion of our financial losses related to the Cyber Event will ultimately be recovered by insurance.Following the Cyber Event, we implemented measures to enhance our cybersecurity protections against, and reduce the potential of, any future cybersecurity attack. We expect to incur ongoing costs to enhance cybersecurity and plan to take further steps to prevent unauthorized access to, or manipulation of, our systems and data. However, there is no guarantee that these enhancements and steps will be adequate to mitigate future losses due to IT system disruptions, and we may incur significant expense in correcting and recovering from future disruptions. To the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including data related to customers, employees or other parties, security breaches may expose us to fines and other liabilities, and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In addition, as cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated and numerous, the costs to defend and insure against cyberattacks can be expected to rise.15Table of ContentsThe impact of potential changes to environmental laws and regulations and industry standards regarding climate change and other sustainability matters could lead to unforeseen disruptions to our business operations.Addressing the effects of climate change has taken on increased importance throughout the world. The continued efforts to combat climate change could include more restrictive federal, state, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, heightened industry standards, or other mitigation measures that may have a material adverse effect on our global operations. These initiatives could, for example, increase the cost of obtaining raw materials for production of our products, increase the cost of energy for our manufacturing processes, negatively impact our supply chain and capital expenditures, or increase our administrative costs. In 2021, we established and publicly disclosed targets and other commitments related to certain sustainability matters, including a goal to reduce our CO2 emissions across our Company and supply chain by 2030. We also set a goal to become a carbon negative enterprise by 2040. If we are unable to meet these targets or commitments on our projected timelines or at all, or if they are perceived negatively, including the perception that they are not sufficiently robust or, conversely, are too costly, our reputation as well as our relationships with investors, customers and other stakeholders could be harmed, which could in turn adversely impact our business, results of operations and the trading price of our common stock. Sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles, and effects in the new construction market and renovation market.Sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country’s or region’s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures or reduction in the use of space by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. In addition, the effects of cyclicality and other factors affecting the corporate office segment have traditionally tended to be more pronounced than the effects on other market segments. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other segment. The effects of cyclicality and other factors on the new construction segment of the market have also tended in the past to be more pronounced than the effects on the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are weakened by negative cycles or other factors.Health crisis events, such as epidemics or pandemics, have adversely impacted, and may continue to impact, the economy and disrupt our operations and supply chains, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Health crisis events, including epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, have impacted areas where we operate and sell our products and could have additional impacts on economic growth, supply chains, and foreign currency exchange rates. Recently, prolonged government imposed COVID-19 restrictions in China and the slow post-COVID recovery in the country adversely impacted our sales in China during fiscal years 2022 and 2023. A public health emergency in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, our results of operations, financial condition, and demand for our products.16Table of ContentsInternational Risk Factors
Our substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including foreign currency fluctuations, restrictive taxation, custom duties, border closings or other adverse government regulations.We have substantial international operations and intend to continue to pursue and commit resources to growth opportunities beyond the United States. Outside of the United States, we maintain manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, China, Australia and Germany, in addition to product showrooms or design studios in England, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, India, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and elsewhere. In 2023, approximately 46% of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific.International operations carry certain risks and associated costs, such as: the complexities and expense of administering a business abroad; complications in compliance with, and unexpected changes in, legal and regulatory restrictions or requirements; foreign laws, international import and export legislation; trading and investment policies; economic and political instability in the global markets; foreign currency fluctuations; exchange controls; increased nationalism and protectionism; crime and social instability; tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; potential adverse tax consequences and increasing tax complexity or changes in tax law associated with operating in multiple tax jurisdictions; uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to intellectual property and privacy rights; difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs, including health and safety regulations and wage and hour laws; potential governmental expropriation (especially in countries with undemocratic or authoritarian ruling parties); and other factors depending upon the jurisdiction involved. There can be no assurance that we will not experience these risks in the future.In addition, due to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations and international operations, including laws that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and that restrict where we can do business, what information or products we can import and export to and from certain countries and what information we can provide to a non-U.S. government. These laws include but are not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Mexican National Anticorruption System (Sistema Nacional Anticorrupción, or “SNA”), the U.S. Export Administration Act and U.S. and international economic sanctions and money laundering regulations. We have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such regulations; however, there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees, agents, business partners or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may result in criminal penalties, sanctions and/or fines that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation. In addition, we are subject to antitrust laws in various countries throughout the world. Changes in these laws or their interpretation, administration or enforcement may occur over time. Any such changes may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures or operations.Finally, we may not be aware of all the factors that may affect our business in foreign jurisdictions. The risks outlined above, and others specific to certain jurisdictions that we may not be aware of, could adversely and materially affect our business and results.The conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.Given the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries and regions, including geopolitical risks arising from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. 17Table of ContentsHistorically, Russia was a key supplier of natural gas, oil, and other raw materials to European countries. We have substantial manufacturing operations in Europe (including Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), and we have key suppliers in Europe, which rely upon natural gas, oil, and other raw materials to operate. Our sole rubber flooring plant is in Germany, and our primary European carpet tile plant is in the Netherlands. Any disruption in the supply of natural gas, oil, or other raw materials from Russia to Europe could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our results of operations and our financial position, or adversely affect the ability of our key suppliers to meet our raw material requirements. In particular, the currently reduced Russian exports of natural gas to Europe may materially impede our European manufacturing operations and may result in higher energy costs to operate our facilities. Our customers’ businesses, results of operations and financial positions also could be adversely impacted by the conflict in Ukraine, which could reduce their spending on our products. While we permanently closed our operations in Russia in the third quarter of 2022, the effects of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on us as well as the global economy cannot be predicted. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war are ongoing and the duration of the conflict and war are uncertain. We cannot predict the outcome of the conflict and war or the impact on the broader region, as the conflict and war and related government actions are evolving and are beyond our control. To the extent the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war adversely affects our business, the conflict and war may also have the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in our Annual Report, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and corporate and consumer spending; disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack, ransom attack, or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; our ability to maintain or increase our prices, including fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs; further disruptions in global supply chains; terrorist activities targeting business infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets. Other potential consequences of the ongoing conflict and war include or may include government sanctions, embargoes, unstable energy markets, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, potential retaliatory action by the governments involved in the conflict and war against companies or other countries, and increased tensions between the involved governments and the United States or other countries in which we operate.Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar have adversely affected our results of operations and financial position and could continue to do so. In recent periods, as the value of the U.S. dollar has strengthened in comparison to certain foreign currencies — particularly in our EAAA segment and the impact of the Euro on our European operations — our reported revenues have been negatively impacted. As approximately 46% of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, these exchange rate fluctuations have had, and could continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our financial results. The uncertainty surrounding the ongoing implementation and effect of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, and related negative developments in the European Union, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.In 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union via a referendum (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The U.K. ceased to be a member of the European Union on January 31, 2020. In December 2020, the U.K. and the European Union agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. The uncertainty leading up to and following Brexit has had, and the ongoing implementation of Brexit may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and demand for our products in Europe, and particularly in the U.K. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere. In addition, Brexit has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or both of the Euro and the British Pound sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars). Such a development could have other unpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our flooring products in the U.K. and in Europe if the U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe.18Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Related to our IndebtednessWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.We have a substantial amount of debt and debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2023, we had approximately $421.7 million of outstanding debt, and we had $298.4 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under our Syndicated Credit Facility.This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: •making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt; •resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable; •reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; •subjecting us to the risk of increasing interest expense on variable rate indebtedness, including borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; •limiting our ability to attract certain investors to purchase our common stock due to the amount of debt we have outstanding; and•limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures.In addition, borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expense will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase. For information regarding the current variable interest rates of these borrowings and the potential impact on our interest expense from hypothetical increases in short term interest rates, please see the discussion in Item 7A of this Report.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.19Table of ContentsServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our indebtedness.Our ability to generate cash in order to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our Syndicated Credit Facility and our other financing agreements, including the indenture governing the Senior Notes, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. Specifically, we will need to maintain certain financial ratios under our Syndicated Credit Facility. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and future borrowings may not be available to us under our existing revolving credit facility or from other sources in an amount sufficient to service our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, to make necessary capital expenditures or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate cash from our operations or through borrowings, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, as well as the terms of our financing agreements, including the Syndicated Credit Facility, and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expense will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase.We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.Subject to the restrictions in our Syndicated Credit Facility and in the indenture governing our Senior Notes, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our Syndicated Credit Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, including the ability, on a non-committed basis, for us to increase revolving commitments and/or term loans under our Syndicated Credit Facility, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks we now face would increase.Legal Risk Factors
We face risks associated with litigation and claims.We have been, and may in the future become, party to lawsuits including, without limitation, actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, or claims relating to intellectual property matters. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An unfavorable judgment against us in any legal proceeding or claim could require us to pay monetary damages. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, an unfavorable judgment in which the counterparty is awarded equitable relief, such as an injunction, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.Please refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” within this Report for additional information related to litigation and claims"
12,TILE,INTERFACE INC,2023-03-01,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock. Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.Risk Factors
 Related to our Business and OperationsWe compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do. We may face challenges competing on price, making investments in our business, or competing on product design or sustainability. The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. Moreover, some of our competitors are adding manufacturing capacity into the industry throughout the globe which could increase the amount of supply in the market. Increased capacity at our competitors could result in pricing pressure on our products and less demand for our products, thus adversely affecting both revenues and profitability. Some of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet and resilient flooring as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do. Competing effectively may require us to make additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network, and sales and marketing activities. In addition, we often compete on design preferences. Our customers’ design preferences may evolve or change before we adapt quickly enough to those changes or before we recognize those changes have happened in the marketplace. If this occurs, it could negatively affect our sales as our customers choose other product offerings that more closely align with their design preferences. Moreover, as our competitors improve the sustainability attributes of their products and operations, or if our competitors market the sustainability attributes of their products or operations more effectively than we do, it could negatively affect the degree to which we differentiate from our competitors on those attributes which could negatively affect our ability to compete and gain those sales as customers choose product offerings from our competitors instead of our product offerings.Our earnings could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, when a test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets.As prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period.We recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $36.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and $121.3 million in the first quarter of 2020. The 2022 impairment charge was primarily a result of macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, rising interest rates and the weakening of the Euro against the U.S. dollar causing a negative impact to our revenue and operating income in our EMEA goodwill reporting unit. The 2020 impairment charge was primarily a result of the expected duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its anticipated negative impact to our revenue and operating income. Future impairment charges could result if these macroeconomic conditions or other negative market events or conditions continue to impact our operations.12Table of ContentsOur success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives, our principal design consultant and other key personnel (including experienced sales and manufacturing personnel), and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our agreement with David Oakey Designs can be terminated by either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. Our business also depends on the recruitment and retention of other key personnel, including experienced sales and manufacturing personnel.The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience.  In certain locations where we operate, the demand for labor has exceeded the supply of labor, resulting in higher costs.  Despite our focused efforts to attract and retain employees, including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances, we experienced attrition rates within our hourly workforce in recent years, particularly in 2021, that exceeded historical levels and we incurred higher operating costs at certain of our facilities in the form of higher levels of overtime pay. The market for professional workers was, and remains, similarly challenging. Many of our professional workers continue to work from home, initially as part of our COVID-19 protocols and more recently as part of our flexible working arrangement policies. As a result, we may experience higher levels of attrition within our professional workforce in the future. We may lose the services of key personnel for a variety of reasons, including if our compensation programs become uncompetitive in the relevant markets for our employees and service providers, or if the Company undergoes significant disruptive change, including economic downturns. The loss of key personnel with a great deal of knowledge, training and experience — particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management — could have an adverse impact on our business. We may not be able to easily replace such personnel, particularly if the underlying reasons for the loss make the Company relatively unattractive as an employer.We continue to implement changes within our sales organization, including to the standardized processes and systems that our sales force uses to go to market, interact with customers, work with architects and the design community and, in general, operate day-to-day. We also continue to improve and change the technology tools that the sales force is required to use as part of their day-to-day jobs and monitor managerial positions that are designed to actively manage and coach the sales force. All of these changes are disruptive, which may create challenges for our sales force to adapt, particularly for long tenured employees. There are no guarantees that these efforts will increase sales or improve profitability of the business, or that they will not instead adversely disrupt the business, decrease sales, and decrease overall profitability. Large increases in the cost of our raw materials, shipping costs, duties or tariffs could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers. Petroleum-based products (including yarn) comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing carpet. Synthetic rubber uses petroleum-based products as feedstock as well. We also incur significant shipping and transport costs to move our products around the globe, and those costs have increased dramatically due to global supply chain, macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued inflation and volatility in the cost of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs could continue to adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such cost increases to our customers.13Table of ContentsUnanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber or our primary third-party supplier for luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) or other key raw materials could have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber and are largely dependent upon two primary suppliers for our LVT products. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon), our primary suppliers of LVT, or other key raw material suppliers, including failure by any third party supplier to meet our product specifications, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products or our own LVT. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately or a shortfall in production by the supplier for reasons unrelated to us, such as work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. The primary manufacturing facility of our largest supplier of LVT is located in South Korea. If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber, our primary suppliers of LVT, or suppliers of other key raw materials are terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier or developing new supply chain sources for LVT. A prolonged inability on our part to source synthetic fiber included in our products, LVT, or other key raw materials on a cost-effective basis could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline. The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward. Changes to our facilities, manufacturing processes, product construction, and product composition could disrupt our operations, increase our manufacturing costs, increase customer complaints, increase warranty claims, negatively affect our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we make improvements and changes to our physical facilities, move operations to other sites, and change our manufacturing processes. In the first quarter of 2022, we permanently closed our carpet tile manufacturing facility in Thailand and transferred that production volume to other existing manufacturing operations in China and Australia. Large scale changes or moves could disrupt our normal operations, leading to possible loss of productivity, which may adversely affect our results. We are also making significant investments and modifications to our manufacturing facilities, processes, product compositions, and product construction including but not limited to the production of our CQuest™ carpet tile backings. These changes can be disruptive. There is also no guarantee that our CQuest™ backings will not fail to perform as expected and will not increase warranty claims or customer complaints. These efforts may also not yield the financial returns and improvements in the business that we hope to achieve from them. While these changes are intended to yield stronger financial results, they could potentially impact our financial results in negative ways due to project delays, business disruption as new facilities and equipment come online, increase customer complaints, or increase warranty claims; all of which could negatively affect our operations, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.  Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes, fire, adverse weather conditions, pandemics, endemics, unstable geopolitical situations or other unexpected events. While we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our manufacturing facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, whether or not as a result of climate change, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions,  acts of war, terrorism, energy shortages and disruptions, pandemics or other public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic described below), or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customers’ facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These types of events could also affect our suppliers, installers, and customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 14Table of ContentsDisruptions to or failures of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely heavily on information technology systems—both software and computer hardware—to operate our business. We rely on these systems to, among other things:•facilitate and plan the purchase, management and distribution of, and payment for, inventory and raw materials;•control our production processes;•manage and monitor our distribution network and logistics;•receive, process and ship orders;•manage billing, collections, cash applications, customer service, and payables;•manage financial reporting; and•manage payroll and human resources information.Our IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including:•natural disasters, like fires;•power loss;•software “bugs”, hardware defects or human error; and•hacking, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, malware, ransomware, phishing scams, compromised or irretrievable backups or other cyber attacks.Any of these events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations. These disruptions may lead to production or shipping stoppages, which may in turn lead to material revenue loss and reputational harm.Despite our security design and internal controls, our IT systems have in the past experienced, and may in the future become subject to, attempts by unauthorized third parties to access and exfiltrate confidential information, manipulate data or disrupt our operations. In November 2022, we discovered a cybersecurity attack, perpetrated by unauthorized third parties, affecting our IT systems (the “Cyber Event”). In response, we promptly shut down certain systems, including shipping, inventory management and production systems and engaged forensic experts to evaluate the extent of the Cyber Event and its disruption to our operations. While the investigation of the Cyber Event by our forensic experts is still ongoing and our operations have fully resumed, we estimate fiscal year 2022 revenues were adversely affected by approximately $8 million due to lost sales. In fiscal 2022, in connection with the Cyber Event, we incurred approximately $5 million of idle plant costs, direct labor costs during the period our manufacturing facilities were idle and third-party remediation costs. We have insurance and anticipate that a portion of our financial losses related to the Cyber Event will ultimately be recovered by insurance.Following the Cyber Event, we implemented measures to enhance our cybersecurity protections against, and reduce the potential of, any future cybersecurity attack. We expect to incur ongoing costs to enhance cybersecurity and plan to take further steps to prevent unauthorized access to, or manipulation of, our systems and data. However, there is no guarantee that these enhancements and steps will be adequate to mitigate future losses due to IT system disruptions, and we may incur significant expense in correcting and recovering from future disruptions. To the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including data related to customers, employees or other parties, security breaches may expose us to fines and other liabilities, and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In addition, as cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated and numerous, the costs to defend and insure against cyberattacks can be expected to rise.The impact of potential changes to environmental laws and regulations and industry standards regarding climate change could lead to unforeseen disruptions to our business operations.Addressing the effects of climate change has taken on increased importance throughout the world. The continued efforts to combat climate change could include more restrictive federal, state, and foreign environmental laws and regulations, heightened industry standards, or other mitigation measures that may have a material adverse effect on our global operations. These initiatives could, for example, increase the cost of obtaining raw materials for production of our products, increase the cost of energy for our manufacturing processes, and negatively impact our supply chain and capital expenditures.  15Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Related to COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic has had and could continue to have (and other public health emergencies could have in the future) a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital investments, our near term and long term ability to stay in compliance with debt covenants under our Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes, our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness, and our ability to obtain financing in capital markets.The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted areas where we operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic or a  similar public health emergency in the future could have a material adverse effect on: our ability to operate; our ability to keep employees safe from public health risks; our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital investments; our near term and long term ability to stay in compliance with debt covenants under our Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes; our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness; and our ability to gain financing in the capital markets.Public health organizations have recommended, and many governments have implemented, measures from time to time during the COVID-19 pandemic to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including certain business shutdowns and shelter in place and social distancing requirements. Such preventive measures, or others we may voluntarily put in place, may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as: the potential shut down of certain locations; decreased employee availability; employee reluctance to receive vaccinations, whether recommended or potentially required; increased overtime and temporary labor costs; potential border closures; and disruptions to the businesses of our selling channel partners, and others. We may also experience manufacturing personnel shortages, which may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products.Our suppliers and customers also have faced these and other challenges, which have led to disruption in our supply chain, raw material inflation, the inability to obtain sufficient raw materials necessary to produce our products, increased shipping and transport costs, as well as decreased construction and renovation spending and decreased demand for our products and services. These issues may also materially affect our current and future access to sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, and access to financing from the capital markets. Although these disruptions may continue to occur, the long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, potential near-term or long-term risk of asset impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments. A public health emergency that occurs in the future could involve similar uncertainties.Sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse economic cycles, and effects in the new construction market and renovation market.Sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country’s or region’s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures or reduction in the use of space by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have cyclical and structural impacts on the renovation of commercial and institutional buildings due to reductions in the use of work spaces, increases in office worker job losses and increases in the number of people working from home. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the corporate office market and what the office of the future might look like and continues to be highly debated by senior executives, commercial real estate firms, architects, designers and other global experts, which could adversely affect the amount of money that customers spend on our products. In addition, the effects of cyclicality and other factors affecting the corporate office segment have traditionally tended to be more pronounced than the effects on other market segments. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other segment. The effects of cyclicality and other factors on the new construction segment of the market have also tended in the past to be more pronounced than the effects on the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are weakened by negative cycles or other factors, including as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.16Table of ContentsInternational Risk Factors
Our substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including foreign currency fluctuations, restrictive taxation, custom duties, border closings or other adverse government regulations.We have substantial international operations and intend to continue to pursue and commit resources to growth opportunities beyond the United States. Outside of the United States, we maintain manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, China, Australia and Germany, in addition to product showrooms or design studios in England, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, India, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Singapore, Hong Kong, China and elsewhere. In 2022, approximately 47% of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific.International operations carry certain risks and associated costs, such as: the complexities and expense of administering a business abroad; complications in compliance with, and unexpected changes in, legal and regulatory restrictions or requirements; foreign laws, international import and export legislation; trading and investment policies; economic and political instability in the global markets; foreign currency fluctuations; exchange controls; increased nationalism and protectionism; crime and social instability; tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; potential adverse tax consequences and increasing tax complexity or changes in tax law associated with operating in multiple tax jurisdictions; uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to intellectual property and privacy rights; difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs, including health and safety regulations and wage and hour laws; potential governmental expropriation (especially in countries with undemocratic or authoritarian ruling parties); and other factors depending upon the jurisdiction involved. There can be no assurance that we will not experience these risks in the future.In addition, due to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations and international operations, including laws that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and that restrict where we can do business, what information or products we can import and export to and from certain countries and what information we can provide to a non-U.S. government. These laws include but are not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Mexican National Anticorruption System (Sistema Nacional Anticorrupción, or “SNA”), the U.S. Export Administration Act and U.S. and international economic sanctions and money laundering regulations. We have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such regulations; however, there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees, agents, business partners or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may result in criminal penalties, sanctions and/or fines that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation. In addition, we are subject to antitrust laws in various countries throughout the world. Changes in these laws or their interpretation, administration or enforcement may occur over time. Any such changes may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures or operations.Finally, we may not be aware of all the factors that may affect our business in foreign jurisdictions. The risks outlined above, and others specific to certain jurisdictions that we may not be aware of, could adversely and materially affect our business and results.The conflict between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.Given the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries and regions, including geopolitical risks arising from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. While we permanently closed our operations in Russia in the third quarter of 2022, the broader consequences of this conflict and the extent of its effects on us as well as the global economy cannot be predicted. These consequences include or may include government sanctions, embargoes, unstable energy markets, regional instability, geopolitical shifts, potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies or other countries, and increased tensions between Russia and the United States or other countries in which we operate.17Table of ContentsHistorically, Russia was a key supplier of natural gas, oil, and other raw materials to European countries. We have substantial manufacturing operations in Europe (including Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom), and we have key suppliers in Europe, which rely upon natural gas, oil, and other raw materials to operate. Our sole rubber flooring plant is in Germany, and our primary European carpet tile plant is in the Netherlands. Any disruption in the supply of natural gas, oil, or other raw materials from Russia to Europe could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our results of operations and our financial position, or adversely affect the ability of our key suppliers to meet our raw material requirements. In particular, the currently reduced Russian exports of natural gas to Europe may materially impede our European manufacturing operations and may result in higher energy costs to operate our facilities. Our customers’ businesses, results of operations and financial positions also could be adversely impacted by the conflict in Ukraine, which could reduce their spending on our products.The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is ongoing and its duration is uncertain. We cannot predict the outcome of the conflict or its impact on the broader region, as the conflict and related government actions are evolving and are beyond our control. To the extent the conflict between Russia and Ukraine adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks disclosed in our Annual Report, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and corporate and consumer spending; disruptions to our global technology infrastructure, including through cyberattack, ransom attack, or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; our ability to maintain or increase our prices, including fuel surcharges in response to rising fuel costs; further disruptions in global supply chains; terrorist activities targeting business infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets.Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the value of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar have adversely affected our results of operations and financial position and could continue to do so. In recent periods, as the value of the U.S. dollar has strengthened in comparison to certain foreign currencies — particularly in our EAAA segment and the impact of the Euro on our European operations — our reported revenues have been negatively impacted. As approximately 47% of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, these exchange rate fluctuations have had, and could continue to have, a significant adverse impact on our financial results. The uncertainty surrounding the ongoing implementation and effect of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.In 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union via a referendum (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The U.K. ceased to be a member of the European Union on January 31, 2020. In December 2020, the U.K. and the European Union agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. The uncertainty leading up to and following Brexit has had, and the ongoing implementation of Brexit may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and demand for our products in Europe, and particularly in the U.K. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere. In addition, Brexit has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or both of the Euro and the British Pound sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars). Such a development could have other unpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our flooring products in the U.K. and in Europe if the U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe.18Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Related to our IndebtednessWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.We have a substantial amount of debt and debt service requirements. As of January 1, 2023, we had approximately $526.3 million of outstanding debt, and we had $274.1 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under our Syndicated Credit Facility.This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: •making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt; •resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable; •reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; •subjecting us to the risk of increasing interest expense on variable rate indebtedness, including borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; •limiting our ability to attract certain investors to purchase our common stock due to the amount of debt we have outstanding; and•limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures.In addition, borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expense will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase. For information regarding the current variable interest rates of these borrowings and the potential impact on our interest expense from hypothetical increases in short term interest rates, please see the discussion in Item 7A of this Report.Furthermore, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Specifically, the FCA stopped publishing one week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates as of December 31, 2021, and the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR rates will cease to be published on June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) in April 2018 as an alternative for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. On September 29, 2022, the FCA announced its decision to stop publishing the 1-month and 6-month LIBOR rates by the end of March 2023. We had exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments, namely our Syndicated Credit Facility which has variable (or floating) interest rates based on LIBOR. This facility allows for the use of an alternative benchmark rate if LIBOR is no longer available. In December 2021 we amended our Syndicated Credit Facility to replace LIBOR with a successor rate for loans denominated in euros or British Pound sterling. In October 2022, we amended our credit facility to replace LIBOR interest rates with the SOFR rate for U.S. denominated loans.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.19Table of ContentsServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our indebtedness.Our ability to generate cash in order to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our Syndicated Credit Facility and our other financing agreements, including the indenture governing the Senior Notes, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. Specifically, we will need to maintain certain financial ratios under our Syndicated Credit Facility. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and future borrowings may not be available to us under our existing revolving credit facility or from other sources in an amount sufficient to service our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, to make necessary capital expenditures or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate cash from our operations or through borrowings, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, as well as the terms of our financing agreements, including the Syndicated Credit Facility, and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expense will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase.We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.Subject to the restrictions in our Syndicated Credit Facility and in the indenture governing our Senior Notes, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our Syndicated Credit Facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, including the ability, on a non-committed basis, for us to increase revolving commitments and/or term loans under our Syndicated Credit Facility, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks we now face would increase.Legal Risk Factors
We face risks associated with litigation and claims.We have been, and may in the future become, party to lawsuits including, without limitation, actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, or claims relating to intellectual property matters. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An unfavorable judgment against us in any legal proceeding or claim could require us to pay monetary damages. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, an unfavorable judgment in which the counterparty is awarded equitable relief, such as an injunction, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.Please refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” within this Report for additional information related to litigation and claims"
5,TILE,INTERFACE INC,2022-03-02,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock. Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Risk Factors
 Related to COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital investments, our near term and long term ability to stay in compliance with debt covenants under our Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes, our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness, and our ability to obtain financing in capital markets.The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact areas where we operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic and similar issues in the future could have a material adverse effect on: our ability to operate; our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic; our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital investments; our near term and long term ability to stay in compliance with debt covenants under our Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes; our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness; and our ability to gain financing in the capital markets. 11Table of ContentsPublic health organizations have recommended, and many governments have implemented, measures from time to time during the pandemic to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including certain business shutdowns and shelter in place and social distancing requirements. Such preventive measures, or others we may voluntarily put in place, may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as: the potential shut down of certain locations; decreased employee availability; employee reluctance to receive COVID-19 vaccinations, whether recommended or potentially required; increased overtime and temporary labor costs; potential border closures; and disruptions to the businesses of our selling channel partners, and others. We may also experience continued manufacturing personnel shortages, which may adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products.Our suppliers and customers also have faced these and other challenges, which have led to disruption in our supply chain, raw material inflation, the inability to obtain sufficient raw materials necessary to produce our products, increased shipping and transport costs, as well as decreased construction and renovation spending and decreased demand for our products and services. These issues may also materially affect our current and future access to sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, and access to financing from the capital markets. Although these disruptions may continue to occur, the long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, potential near-term or long-term risk of asset impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments.Sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse economic cycles, and effects in the new construction market and renovation market.Sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country’s or region’s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures, or reduction in the use of space, by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic may have cyclical and structural impacts on this activity resulting from job losses for office workers, reductions in the use of coworking spaces, and increases in the number of people working from home. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the future of the office, and what the office of the future might look like, is being highly debated by senior executives, commercial real estate firms, architects, designers and other global experts which could adversely affect the amount of money that customers spend on our products. In addition, the effects of cyclicality and other factors affecting the corporate office segment have traditionally tended to be more pronounced than the effects on other market segments. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other segment. The effects of cyclicality and other factors on the new construction segment of the market have also tended in the past to be more pronounced than the effects on the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are weakened by negative cycles or other factors, including as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.12Table of ContentsOur earnings could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, when a test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets.As prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period.We recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment loss of $121.3 million in the first quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of the expected duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its anticipated negative impact to our revenue and operating income. Future impairment charges could result if these expectations change or the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period.International Risk Factors
Our substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including foreign currency fluctuations, restrictive taxation, custom duties, border closings or other adverse government regulations.We have substantial international operations and intend to continue to pursue and commit resources to growth opportunities beyond the United States. Outside of the United States, we maintain manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, China, Thailand (anticipated closure at the end of the first quarter of 2022), Australia and Germany, in addition to product showrooms or design studios in Mexico, England, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, India, Australia, United Arab Emirates, Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, China and elsewhere. In 2021, approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific.International operations carry certain risks and associated costs, such as: the complexities and expense of administering a business abroad; complications in compliance with, and unexpected changes in, legal and regulatory restrictions or requirements; foreign laws, international import and export legislation; trading and investment policies; economic and political instability in the global markets; foreign currency fluctuations; exchange controls; increased nationalism and protectionism; crime and social instability; tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; potential adverse tax consequences and increasing tax complexity or changes in tax law associated with operating in multiple tax jurisdictions; uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to intellectual property and privacy rights; difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs, including health and safety regulations and wage and hour laws; potential governmental expropriation (especially in countries with undemocratic or authoritarian ruling parties); and other factors depending upon the jurisdiction involved. There can be no assurance that we will not experience these risks in the future.Risks include, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the ongoing implementation and effect of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union described below, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union. We conduct business in Russia and Ukraine, which subjects us to risks inherent with current geopolitical tensions between the two countries.We also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars (approximately half of 2021 net sales), which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations. The scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results.13Table of ContentsIn addition, due to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations and international operations, including laws that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and that restrict where we can do business, what information or products we can import and export to and from certain countries and what information we can provide to a non-U.S. government. These laws include but are not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Mexican National Anticorruption System (Sistema Nacional Anticorrupción, or “SNA”), the U.S. Export Administration Act and U.S. and international economic sanctions and money laundering regulations. We have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such regulations; however, there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees, agents, business partners or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may result in criminal penalties, sanctions and/or fines that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation. In addition, we are subject to antitrust laws in various countries throughout the world. Changes in these laws or their interpretation, administration or enforcement may occur over time. Any such changes may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures or operations.Finally, we may not be aware of all the factors that may affect our business in foreign jurisdictions. The risks outlined above, and others specific to certain jurisdictions that we may not be aware of, could adversely and materially affect our business and results. The uncertainty surrounding the ongoing implementation and effect of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union via a referendum (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The U.K. ceased to be a member of the European Union on January 31, 2020. In December 2020, the U.K. and the European Union agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. The uncertainty leading up to and following Brexit has had, and the ongoing implementation of Brexit may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and demand for our products in Europe, and particularly in the U.K. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere. In addition, Brexit has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or both of the Euro and the British Pound sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars). Such a development could have other unpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our flooring products in the U.K. and in Europe if the U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe.Risk Factors
 Related to our IndebtednessWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.We have a substantial amount of debt and debt service requirements. As of January 2, 2022, we had approximately $525.1 million of outstanding debt, and we had $290.9 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility.This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: •making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt; •resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable; •reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; •subjecting us to the risk of increasing interest expense on variable rate indebtedness, including borrowings under our existing credit facility;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;14Table of Contents•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; •limiting our ability to attract certain investors to purchase our common stock due to the amount of debt we have outstanding; and•limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures.In addition, borrowings under our credit facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expense will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase.Furthermore, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Specifically, the FCA stopped publishing one week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR rates as of December 31, 2021, and the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR rates will cease to be published on June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) in April 2018 as an alternative for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to SOFR or another benchmark rate may occur over the course of the next few years. We have exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments, namely our existing credit facility which has variable (or floating) interest rates based on LIBOR. This facility allows for the use of an alternative benchmark rate if LIBOR is no longer available. In December 2021, we amended our existing credit facility to replace LIBOR with a successor rate for loans denominated in euros or British Pound sterling. At this time, we cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of LIBOR on our U.S. dollar denominated loans under the existing credit facility or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our indebtedness.Our ability to generate cash in order to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our existing credit facility and our other financing agreements, including the indenture governing the Senior Notes, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. Specifically, we will need to maintain certain financial ratios under our existing credit facility. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and future borrowings may not be available to us under our existing revolving credit facility or from other sources in an amount sufficient to service our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, to make necessary capital expenditures or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate cash from our operations or through borrowings, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, as well as the terms of our financing agreements, including the existing credit facility, and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations. In addition, borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expense will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase.We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.Subject to the restrictions in our existing credit facility and in the indenture governing our Senior Notes, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our existing credit facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, including the ability, on a non-committed basis, for us to increase revolving commitments and/or term loans under our existing credit facility, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks we now face would increase.15Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Related to our Business and OperationsWe compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do. We may face challenges competing on price, making investments in our business, or competing on product design. The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. Moreover, some of our competitors are adding manufacturing capacity into the industry throughout the globe which could increase the amount of supply in the market. Increased capacity at our competitors could result in pricing pressure on our products (including products, like LVT, which may currently carry attractive margins) and less demand for our products, thus adversely affecting both revenues and profitability. Some of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet and resilient flooring as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do. Competing effectively may require us to make additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. In addition, we often compete on design preferences. Our customers’ design preferences may evolve or change before we adapt quickly enough to those changes or before we recognize those changes have happened in the marketplace. If this occurs, it could negatively affect our sales as our customers choose other product offerings. Our success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives, our principal design consultant and other key personnel (including experienced sales and manufacturing personnel), and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our agreement with David Oakey Designs can be terminated by either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. Our business also depends on the recruitment and retention of other key personnel, including experienced sales and manufacturing personnel.The increasing demand for qualified personnel makes it more difficult for us to attract and retain employees with requisite skill sets, particularly employees with specialized technical and trade experience.  In certain locations where we operate, the demand for labor has exceeded the supply of labor, resulting in higher costs.  Despite our focused efforts to attract and retain employees, including by offering higher levels of compensation in certain instances, we experienced attrition rates within our hourly workforce in fiscal 2021 that exceeded historical levels and we incurred higher operating costs at certain of our facilities in the form of higher levels of overtime pay. The market for professional workers was, and remains, similarly challenging. Many of our professional workers continue to work from home as part of our COVID-19 protocols and, although in most instances we expect to offer flexible working arrangements in the future, we may experience higher levels of attrition within our professional workforce. We may lose the services of key personnel for a variety of reasons, including if our compensation programs become uncompetitive in the relevant markets for our employees and service providers, or if the Company undergoes significant disruptive change (including not only economic downturns, but potentially other changes management believes are positive in the long term). The loss of key personnel with a great deal of knowledge, training and experience in the flooring industry — particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management — could have an adverse impact on our business. We may not be able to easily replace such personnel, particularly if the underlying reasons for the loss make the Company relatively unattractive as an employer.We continue to implement a multi-year transformation of our sales organization, including the standardized processes and systems that our sales force uses to go to market, interact with customers, work with architects and the design community and, in general, operate day-to-day. We also continue to improve and change the technology tools that the sales force is required to use as part of their day-to-day jobs, and monitor managerial positions that are designed to actively manage and coach the sales force. All of these changes are disruptive, which may create challenges for our sales force to adapt, particularly for long tenured employees, which comprise a large portion of our sales force. There are no guarantees that these efforts will increase sales or improve profitability of the business, or that they will not instead adversely disrupt the business, decrease sales, and decrease overall profitability. 16Table of ContentsLarge increases in the cost of our raw materials, shipping costs, duties or tariffs could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers. Petroleum-based products (including yarn) comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing carpet. Synthetic rubber uses petroleum-based products as feedstock as well. We also incur significant shipping and transport costs to move our products around the globe, and those costs have increased dramatically due to recent global supply chain challenges. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued inflation and volatility in the cost of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such cost increases to our customers.Unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber or our primary third-party supplier for luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) or other key raw materials could have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber and are largely dependent upon two primary suppliers for our LVT products. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon), our primary suppliers of LVT, or other key raw material suppliers, including failure by any third party supplier to meet our product specifications, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products or our own LVT. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately or a shortfall in production by the supplier for reasons unrelated to us, such as work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. The primary manufacturing facility of our largest supplier of LVT is located in South Korea. If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber, our primary suppliers of LVT, or suppliers of other key raw materials are terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier or developing new supply chain sources for LVT. A prolonged inability on our part to source synthetic fiber included in our products, LVT, or other key raw materials on a cost-effective basis could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline. The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward. Changes to our facilities, manufacturing processes, product construction, and product composition could disrupt our operations, increase our manufacturing costs, increase customer complaints, increase warranty claims, negatively affect our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we make improvements and changes to our physical facilities, move operations to other sites, and change our manufacturing processes. We are also in the process of closing our carpet tile manufacturing facility in Thailand. Large scale changes or moves could disrupt our normal operations, leading to possible loss of productivity, which may adversely affect our results. We are also making significant investments and modifications to our manufacturing facilities, processes, product compositions, and product construction including but not limited to the production of our new CQuest™ carpet tile backings. These changes can be disruptive. There is also no guarantee that our CQuest™ backings will not fail to perform as expected and will not increase warranty claims or customer complaints. These efforts may also not yield the financial returns and improvements in the business that we hope to achieve from them. While these changes are intended to yield stronger financial results, they could potentially impact our financial results in negative ways due to project delays, business disruption as new facilities and equipment come online, increase customer complaints, or increase warranty claims; all of which could negatively affect our operations, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.  17Table of ContentsOur business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, catastrophes, fire, adverse weather conditions, pandemics, endemics or other unexpected events. While we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our manufacturing facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, whether or not as a result of climate change, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions,  acts of war, terrorism, pandemics or other public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic described above), or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customers’ facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These types of events could also affect our suppliers, installers, and customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Disruptions to or failures of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely heavily on information technology systems—both software and computer hardware—to operate our business. We rely on these systems to, among other things:•facilitate and plan the purchase, management and distribution of, and payment for, inventory and raw materials;•control our production processes;•manage and monitor our distribution network and logistics;•receive, process and ship orders;•manage billing, collections, cash applications, customer service, and payables;•manage financial reporting; and•manage payroll and human resources information.Our IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including:•natural disasters, like fires;•power loss;•software “bugs”, hardware defects or human error; and•hacking, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, malware, ransomware, phishing scams, or other cyber attacks. Any of these events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations. These disruptions may lead to production or shipping stoppages, which may in turn lead to material revenue loss and reputational harm. There is no guarantee that our backup systems or disaster recovery procedures will be adequate to mitigate losses due to IT system disruptions in a timely fashion, and we may incur significant expense in correcting IT system emergencies. To the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including about our employees or other individuals, security breaches may expose us to other serious liabilities and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In addition, as cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated and numerous, the costs to defend and insure against cyberattacks can be expected to rise.Legal Risk Factors
We face risks associated with litigation and claims.We have been, and may in the future become, party to lawsuits including, without limitation, actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, or claims relating to intellectual property matters. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An unfavorable judgment against us in any legal proceeding or claim could require us to pay monetary damages. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, an unfavorable judgment in which the counterparty is awarded equitable relief, such as an injunction, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.Please refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” within this Report for additional information related to litigation and claims.18Table of Contents"
11,TILE,INTERFACE INC,2021-03-03,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock. Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Risk Factors
 Related to COVID-19The COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital investments, our near term and long term ability to stay in compliance with debt covenants under our Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes, our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness, and our ability to obtain financing in capital markets.The World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the virus continues to spread in areas where we operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic and similar issues in the future could have a material adverse effect on: our ability to operate; our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic; our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital investments; our near term and long term ability to stay in compliance with debt covenants under our Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes; our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness; and our ability to gain financing in the capital markets. Public health organizations have recommended, and many governments have implemented, measures from time to time during the pandemic to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including certain business shutdowns and shelter in place and social distancing requirements. Such preventive measures, or others we may voluntarily put in place, may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as: the potential shut down of certain locations; decreased employee availability; potential border closures; and disruptions to the businesses of our selling channel partners, and others.Our suppliers and customers may also face these and other challenges, which could lead to a disruption in our supply chain, raw material inflation or the inability to get the raw materials necessary to produce our products, increased shipping and transport costs, as well as decreased construction and renovation spending and decreased demand for our products and services. These issues may also materially affect our current and future access to sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, and access to financing from the capital markets. Although these disruptions may continue to occur, the long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, potential near-term or long-term risk of asset impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments.Sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse economic cycles, and effects in the new construction market and renovation market.Sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country’s or region’s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures, or reduction in the use of space, by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic may have cyclical and structural impacts on this activity resulting from job losses for office workers, reductions in the use of coworking spaces, and increases in the number of people working from home. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the future of the office, and what the office of the future might look like, is being highly debated by senior executives, commercial real estate firms, architects, designers and other global experts which could adversely affect the amount of money that customers spend on our products. In addition, the effects of cyclicality and other factors affecting the corporate office segment have traditionally tended to be more pronounced than the effects on other market segments. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other segment. The effects of cyclicality and other factors on the new construction segment of the market have also tended in the past to be more pronounced than the effects on the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are weakened by negative cycles or other factors, including as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.12Table of ContentsOur earnings could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, when a test of goodwill assets indicate a material impairment of those assets.As prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period.We recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment loss of $121.3 million in the first quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of the expected duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its anticipated negative impact to our revenue and operating income. Future impairment charges could result if these expectations change or the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period.International Risk Factors
Our substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations.We have substantial international operations and intend to continue to pursue and commit resources to growth opportunities beyond the United States. Outside of the United States, we maintain manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, China, Thailand, Australia and Germany, in addition to product showrooms or design studios in Canada, Mexico, England, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, India, Australia, Norway, United Arab Emirates, Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, China and elsewhere. In 2020, approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific.International operations carry certain risks and associated costs, such as: the complexities and expense of administering a business abroad; complications in compliance with, and unexpected changes in, legal and regulatory restrictions or requirements; foreign laws, international import and export legislation; trading and investment policies; economic and political instability in the global markets; foreign currency fluctuations; exchange controls; increased nationalism and protectionism; tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; potential adverse tax consequences and increasing tax complexity or changes in tax law associated with operating in multiple tax jurisdictions; uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to intellectual property and privacy rights; difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs, including health and safety regulations and wage and hour laws; potential governmental expropriation (especially in countries with undemocratic or authoritarian ruling parties); and other factors depending upon the jurisdiction involved. There can be no assurance that we will not experience these risks in the future.Risks include, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union described below, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union.We also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars (approximately half of 2020 net sales), which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations. The scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results.13Table of ContentsIn addition, due to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations and international operations, including laws that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and that restrict where we can do business, what information or products we can import and export to and from certain countries and what information we can provide to a non-U.S. government. These laws include but are not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Mexican National Anticorruption System (Sistema Nacional Anticorrupción, or “SNA”), the U.S. Export Administration Act and U.S. and international economic sanctions and money laundering regulations. We have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such regulations; however, there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees, agents, business partners, joint venture partners or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may result in criminal penalties, sanctions and/or fines that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation. In addition, we are subject to antitrust laws in various countries throughout the world. Changes in these laws or their interpretation, administration or enforcement may occur over time. Any such changes may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures or operations.Finally, we may not be aware of all the factors that may affect our business in foreign jurisdictions. The risks outlined above, and others specific to certain jurisdictions that we may not be aware of, could adversely and materially affect our business and results. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union via a referendum (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The U.K. ceased to be a member of the European Union on January 31, 2020. In December 2020, the U.K. and the European Union agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement, which is being applied provisionally until it is formally ratified by the European Union parliament. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. The uncertainty leading up to and following Brexit has had, and the implementation of Brexit may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and demand for our products in Europe, and particularly in the U.K. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere. In addition, Brexit has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or both of the Euro and the British pound sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars). Such a development could have other unpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our flooring products in the U.K. and in Europe if the U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe.Risk Factors
 Related to our IndebtednessWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.We have a substantial amount of debt and debt service requirements. As of January 3, 2021, we had approximately $585.2 million of outstanding debt, and we had $295.4 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility.This level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including: •making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt; •resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable; •reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; •subjecting us to the risk of increasing interest expense on variable rate indebtedness, including borrowings under our existing credit facility;14Table of Contents•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; •limiting our ability to attract certain investors to purchase our common stock due to the amount of debt we have outstanding; and•limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures.In addition, borrowings under our credit facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expenses will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase.Furthermore, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021, and LIBOR may be discontinued or modified by 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) in April 2018 as an alternative for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to SOFR or another benchmark rate may occur over the course of the next few years. We have exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments, namely our existing credit facility which has variable (or floating) interest rates based on LIBOR. This facility allows for the use of an alternative benchmark rate if LIBOR is no longer available. At this time, we cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates.Any of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our indebtedness.Our ability to generate cash in order to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our existing credit facility and our other financing agreements, including the indenture governing the Senior Notes, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. Specifically, we will need to maintain certain financial ratios under our existing credit facility. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and future borrowings may not be available to us under our existing revolving credit facility or from other sources in an amount sufficient to service our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, to make necessary capital expenditures or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate cash from our operations or through borrowings, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, as well as the terms of our financing agreements, including the existing credit facility, and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.We may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.Subject to the restrictions in our existing credit facility and in the indenture governing our Senior Notes, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our existing credit facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, including the ability, on a non-committed basis, for us to increase revolving commitments and/or term loans under our existing credit facility, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries’ existing debt levels, the related risks we now face would increase.15Table of ContentsRisk Factors
 Related to our Business and OperationsWe compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do. We may face challenges competing on price, making investments in our business, or competing on product design. The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. Moreover, some of our competitors are adding manufacturing capacity into the industry throughout the globe which could increase the amount of supply in the market. Increased capacity at our competitors could result in pricing pressure on our products (including products, like LVT, which may currently carry attractive margins) and less demand for our products, thus adversely affecting both revenues and profitability. Some of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet and resilient flooring as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do. Competing effectively may require us to make additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. In addition, we often compete on design preferences. Our customers’ design preferences may evolve or change before we adapt quickly enough to those changes or before we recognize those changes have happened in the marketplace. If this occurs, it could negatively affect our sales as our customers choose other product offerings. Our success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives, our principal design consultant and other key personnel (including sales personnel), and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our agreement with David Oakey Designs can be terminated by either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. Our business also depends on the recruitment and retention of other key personnel, including strong sales leaders. We may lose the services of key personnel for a variety of reasons, including if our compensation programs become uncompetitive in the relevant markets for our employees and service providers, or if the Company undergoes significant disruptive change (including not only economic downturns, but potentially other changes management believes are positive in the long term). The loss of key personnel with a great deal of knowledge, training and experience in the flooring industry — particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management — could have an adverse impact on our business. We may not be able to easily replace such personnel, particularly if the underlying reasons for the loss make the Company relatively unattractive as an employer.We are implementing a multi-year transformation of our sales organization, including the implementation of standardized processes in which our sales force goes to market, interacts with customers, works with the architect and design community and, in general, operates day-to-day. We are also implementing technology tools that the sales force will be required to use as part of their day-to-day jobs, and new management positions to actively manage and coach the sales force. All of these changes are disruptive, which may create challenges for our sales force to adapt, particularly for long tenured employees, which comprise a large portion of our sales force. There are no guarantees that these efforts will increase sales or improve profitability of the business, or that they will not instead adversely disrupt the business, decrease sales, and decrease overall profitability. Large increases in the cost of our raw materials, shipping costs, duties or tariffs could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers. Petroleum-based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing carpet. Synthetic rubber uses petroleum based products as feedstock as well. We also incur significant shipping and transport costs to move our products around the globe. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued volatility in the cost of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such cost increases to our customers.16Table of ContentsUnanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole third party supplier for luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) could have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber and a single supplier for our LVT products. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon) or sole supplier of LVT, including failure by any third party supplier to meet our product specifications, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products or our own LVT. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately or a shortfall in production by the supplier for reasons unrelated to us, such as work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. The primary manufacturing facility of our sole supplier of LVT is located in South Korea. If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole supplier of LVT is terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier or developing new supply chain sources for LVT. A prolonged inability on our part to source synthetic fiber included in our products or LVT on a cost-effective basis could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships. If we fail to realize the expected synergies and other benefits of the nora acquisition, our results of operations and stock price may be negatively affected. In 2018, we completed the acquisition of nora, a manufacturer and multinational marketer of resilient rubber floor coverings.  The success of the acquisition will depend substantially on our ability to realize the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the Company’s legacy business and nora.  Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks that: •we may not be able to successfully combine and integrate the businesses on a timely basis, or at all;•the integration process could divert management’s attention, cause employee or customer attrition or cause other disruption;•nora may not contribute to the revenues and profitability of the combined business as much as we currently expect; and•we may not be able to manage the increased indebtedness we have incurred in connection with the acquisition.If we are not able to successfully combine the businesses within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected synergies and other benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the results of our operations or value of our common stock may be adversely affected. It is also possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or customers of the Company or nora, the disruption of the companies’ ongoing businesses or unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the Company’s legacy operations and nora. It is possible that the integration process could result in: •diversion of management’s attention;•the lack of personnel or other resources to pursue other potential business opportunities; and•the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect each company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or their ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, or could reduce each company’s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company and the value of our common stock.17Table of ContentsThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline. The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward. Changes to our facilities, manufacturing processes, product construction, and product composition could disrupt our operations, increase customer complaints, increase warranty claims, negatively affect our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.From time to time, we make improvements to our physical facilities, or move operations to new ones. Large scale changes or moves could disrupt our normal operations, leading to possible loss of productivity, which may adversely affect our results. We are also making significant investments and modifications to our manufacturing facilities, processes, product compositions, and product construction including but not limited to the production of our new CQuest™ carpet tile backings. These changes can be disruptive. There is also no guarantee that our CQuest™ backings will not fail to perform as expected and will not increase warranty claims or customer complaints. These efforts may also not yield the financial returns and improvements in the business that we hope to achieve from them. While these changes are intended to yield stronger financial results, they could potentially impact our financial results in negative ways due to project delays, business disruption as new facilities and equipment come online, increase customer complaints, or increase warranty claims; all of which could negatively affect our operations, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.  Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire, pandemics or other unexpected events. While we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our manufacturing facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions, pandemics or other public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic described above), or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customers’ facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions to or failures of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely heavily on information technology systems—both software and computer hardware—to operate our business. We rely on these systems to, among other things:•facilitate and plan the purchase, management and distribution of, and payment for, inventory and raw materials;•control our production processes;•manage and monitor our distribution network and logistics;•receive, process and ship orders;•manage billing, collections and payables;•manage financial reporting; and•manage payroll and human resources information.Our IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including:•natural disasters, like fires;•power loss;•software “bugs”, hardware defects or human error; and•hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing scams, or other cyber attacks. Any of these events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations. These disruptions may lead to production or shipping stoppages, which may in turn lead to material revenue loss and reputational harm. There is no guarantee that our backup systems or disaster recovery procedures will be adequate to mitigate losses due to IT system disruptions in a timely fashion, and we may incur significant expense in correcting IT system emergencies.18Table of Contents To the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including about our employees or other individuals, security breaches may expose us to other serious liabilities and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In addition, as cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated, the costs to defend and insure against cyberattacks can be expected to rise.Legal Risk Factors
We face risks associated with litigation and claims.We have been, and may in the future become, party to lawsuits including, without limitation, actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, or claims relating to intellectual property matters. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An unfavorable judgment against us in any legal proceeding or claim could require us to pay monetary damages. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, an unfavorable judgment in which the counterparty is awarded equitable relief, such as an injunction, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.Please refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” within this Report for additional information related to litigation and claims.19Table of Contents"
0,TILE,INTERFACE INC,2020-02-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock. Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. Sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country’s or region’s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. The effects of cyclicality upon the corporate office segment tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the institutional segment. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other market. The effects of cyclicality upon the new construction segment of the market also tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are weakened. We compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do. We may face challenges competing on price, making investments in our business, or competing on product design. The floorcovering industry is highly competitive.

If this occurs, it could negatively affect our sales as our customers choose other product offerings. Our success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives, our principal design consultant and other key personnel (including sales personnel), and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our agreement with David Oakey Designs can be terminated by either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. Our business also depends on the recruitment and retention of other key personnel, including strong sales leaders. We may lose the services of key personnel for a variety of reasons, including if our compensation programs become uncompetitive in the relevant markets for our employees and service providers, or if the Company undergoes significant disruptive change (including not only economic downturns, but potentially other changes management believes are positive in the long term).

We are also implementing technology tools that the sales force will be required to use as part of their day-to-day jobs, and new management positions to actively manage and coach the sales force. All of these changes are disruptive, which may create challenges for our sales force to adapt, particularly for long tenured employees, which comprise a large portion of our sales force. There are no guarantees that these efforts will increase sales or improve profitability of the business, or that they will not instead adversely disrupt the business, decrease sales, and decrease overall profitability. Our substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations. We have substantial international operations. In 2019, approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our corporate strategy includes the expansion and growth of our international business on a worldwide basis. As a result, our operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political conditions and governmental regulations. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union. We also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars (approximately half of 2019 net sales), which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations. The scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results. In addition, political unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict and disease outbreaks have increased the risks of doing business abroad generally. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. In 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union via a referendum (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). In 2017, the U.K. notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, and the U.K. exited the European Union on January 31, 2020. A complex and uncertain process of negotiation is taking place to determine trade agreements as well as other aspects of the U.K.’s relationship with the European Union. The uncertainty leading up to and following Brexit has had, and the implementation of Brexit may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and demand for our products in Europe, and particularly in the U.K. The long-term nature of the U.K.’s relationship with the European Union is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty as to when any agreement or long-term relationship strategy, including trade deals, will be agreed to and implemented by the U.K. and the European Union. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere. In addition, Brexit has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or both of the euro and the British pound sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars). Such a development could have other unpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our flooring products in the U.K. and in Europe if the U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe.Our manufacturing and supply chain abilities may be adversely impacted by an extended shutdown of our operations in China due to the recent coronavirus outbreak.       In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus began to impact the population of China, and it began to spread globally. In late January 2020, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus, maintain the wellbeing of our employees and in accordance with governmental requirements, we temporarily closed our manufacturing facility in China through February 9, 2020. While the closure and limitations on movement in the region are expected to be temporary, the duration of the production and supply chain disruption, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time. Should the production facility closure reoccur, or such disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our supply chain in China and globally could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. 15The SEC’s investigation into our earnings per share (“EPS”) calculations and rounding practices could result in potential sanctions or penalties, distraction to our management and result in litigation from third parties, each of which could adversely affect or cause variability in our results of operations and financial condition.In November 2017, the SEC began an investigation into our EPS calculations and rounding practices.  The investigation is ongoing and there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulatory body will not make further regulatory inquiries or pursue further action that could result in significant costs and expenses including potential sanctions or penalties as well as distraction to management. In addition, the Company may be subject to litigation from third parties related to the matters under review by the SEC. Accordingly, the ongoing SEC investigation and/or any related litigation may give rise to risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect or cause variability in our results of operations and financial condition.  Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, uncertainty as to the scope, timing and ultimate findings of the matters under review by the SEC (collectively, the “investigation”); adverse effects of the investigation, including the potential financial impact on the Company in the event of an adverse outcome and on the market price of the Company’s common stock; the costs and expenses of the investigation, including legal fees and possible monetary penalties in the event of an adverse outcome; the risk of potential litigation or regulatory action arising from these matters; the timing of the review by the Company regarding these matters; the potential identification of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures and the impact of the same; and potential reputational damage that the Company may suffer as a result of the matters under investigation. Large increases in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers. Petroleum-based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing carpet. Synthetic rubber uses petroleum based products as feedstock as well. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued volatility in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such price increases to our customers.Unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole third party supplier for luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) could have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber and a single supplier for our LVT products. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon) or sole supplier of LVT, including failure by any third party supplier to meet our product specifications, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products or our own LVT. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately or a shortfall in production by the supplier for reasons unrelated to us, such as work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. The primary manufacturing facility of our sole supplier of LVT is located in South Korea, which recently reported an outbreak of the novel coronavirus described above. If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole supplier of LVT is terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier or developing new supply chain sources for LVT. A prolonged inability on our part to source synthetic fiber included in our products or LVT on a cost-effective basis could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships. If we fail to realize the expected synergies and other benefits of the nora acquisition, our results of operations and stock price may be negatively affected. We recently completed the acquisition of nora, a manufacturer and multinational marketer of resilient rubber floor coverings.  The success of the acquisition will depend substantially on our ability to realize the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the Company’s legacy business and nora.  Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks that: •we may not be able to successfully combine and integrate the businesses on a timely basis, or at all;•the integration process could divert management’s attention, cause employee or customer attrition or cause other disruption;•nora may not contribute to the revenues and profitability of the combined business as much as we currently expect; or•we may not be able to manage the increased indebtedness we have incurred in connection with the acquisition.16If we are not able to successfully combine the businesses within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected synergies and other benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the results of our operations or value of our common stock may be adversely affected. It is also possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or customers of the Company or nora, the disruption of the companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the Company’s legacy operations and nora. It is possible that the integration process could result in: •diversion of management’s attention;•the lack of personnel or other resources to pursue other potential business opportunities; and•the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect each company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or their ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, or could reduce each company’s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company and the value of our common stock. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could have important negative consequences to us. Our significant indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including:•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness;•increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;•requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;•placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and•limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures.It is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness. As a consequence of our level of indebtedness, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service requirements. In addition, borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expenses will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase. The terms of our Syndicated Credit Facility also limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations, consummate certain asset sales, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, create liens, merge or consolidate with any other person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. They also require us to comply with certain other reporting, affirmative and negative covenants and meet certain financial tests. If we fail to satisfy these tests or comply with these covenants, a default may occur, in which case the lenders could accelerate the debt as well as any other debt to which cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions apply. Our Syndicated Credit Facility matures in August 2023. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate, refinance or otherwise obtain the necessary funds to satisfy these obligations. If we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing, we would have to consider other options, such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs, or using cash, if available, that would have been used for other business purposes. 17On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021, and LIBOR may be discontinued or modified by 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) in April 2018 as an alternative for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to SOFR or another benchmark rate may occur over the course of the next few years. We have exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments, namely our floating rate Syndicated Credit Facility. This facility allows for the use of an alternative benchmark rate if LIBOR is no longer available. At this time, we cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline. The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward. Our earnings in a future period could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, if a future test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets. As prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. In the past, we have had non-cash adjustments for goodwill impairment as a result of such testings ($61.2 million in 2008 and $44.5 million in 2007). A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period. Changes to our facilities could disrupt our operations. From time to time, we make improvements to our physical facilities, or move operations to new ones. Large scale changes or moves could disrupt our normal operations, leading to possible loss of productivity, which may adversely affect our results.We are also making significant investments and modifications to our manufacturing facilities, particularly in LaGrange, Georgia. At times this process can be disruptive, and there is no guarantee that these efforts will yield the financial returns and improvements in the business that we hope to achieve from them. In addition, while these changes are intended to yield stronger financial results, they could potentially adversely affect financial results due to project delays, business disruption as new facilities and equipment come online, and general disruption as we make changes and modifications to our manufacturing facilities and processes. Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire, pandemics or other unexpected events. While we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our manufacturing facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions, pandemics or other public health crises (such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus described above), or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customers’ facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 18Disruptions to or failures of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business. We rely heavily on information technology systems—both software and computer hardware—to operate our business. We rely on these systems to, among other things:•facilitate and plan the purchase, management and distribution of, and payment for, inventory and raw materials;•control our production processes;•manage and monitor our distribution network and logistics;•receive, process and ship orders;•manage billing, collections and payables;•manage financial reporting; and•manage payroll and human resources information.Our IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including:•natural disasters, like fires;•power loss;•software “bugs”, hardware defects or human error; or•hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other cyber attacks. Any of these events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations. These disruptions may lead to production or shipping stoppages, which may in turn lead to material revenue loss and reputational harm. There is no guarantee that our backup systems or disaster recovery procedures will be adequate to mitigate losses due to IT system disruptions in a timely fashion, and we may incur significant expense in correcting IT system emergencies. To the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including about our employees or other individuals, security breaches may expose us to other serious liabilities and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In addition, as cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated, the costs to defend and insure against cyberattacks can be expected to rise. 19"

RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock.  Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. Sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country’s or region’s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. The effects of cyclicality upon the corporate office segment tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the institutional segment. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other market. The effects of cyclicality upon the new construction segment of the market also tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are weakened. We compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do.  We may face challenges competing on price, making investments in our business, or competing on product design. The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. Moreover, some of our competitors are adding manufacturing capacity into the industry throughout the globe which could increase the amount of supply in the market. Increased capacity at our competitors could result in pricing pressure on our products (including products, like LVT, which may currently carry attractive margins) and less demand for our products, thus adversely affecting both revenues and profitability. Some of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet and resilient flooring as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do. Competing effectively may require us to make additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. In addition, we often compete on design preferences. Our customers’ design preferences may evolve or change before we adapt quickly enough to those changes or before we recognize those changes have happened in the marketplace. If this occurs, it could negatively affect our sales as our customers choose other product offerings. Our success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives, our principal design consultant and other key personnel (including sales personnel), and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our agreement with David Oakey Designs can be terminated by either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. Our business also depends on the recruitment and retention of other key personnel, including strong sales leaders. We may lose the services of key personnel for a variety of reasons, including if our compensation programs become uncompetitive in the relevant markets for our employees and service providers, or if the Company undergoes significant disruptive change (including not only economic downturns, but potentially other changes management believes are positive in the long term). The loss of key personnel with a great deal of knowledge, training and experience in the flooring industry – particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management – could have an adverse impact on our business. We may not be able to easily replace such personnel, particularly if the underlying reasons for the loss make the Company relatively unattractive as an employer. 13Table of Contents We are implementing a multi-year transformation of our sales organization, including the implementation of standardized processes in which our sales force goes to market, interacts with customers, works with the architect and design community and, in general, operates day-to-day. We are also implementing technology tools that the sales force will be required to use as part of their day-to-day jobs, and new management positions to actively manage and coach the sales force. All of these changes are disruptive, which may create challenges for our sales force to adapt, particularly for long tenured employees, which comprise a large portion of our sales force. There are no guarantees that these efforts will increase sales or improve profitability of the business, or that they will not instead adversely disrupt the business, decrease sales, and decrease overall profitability. Our substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations. We have substantial international operations. In 2018, approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our corporate strategy includes the expansion and growth of our international business on a worldwide basis. As a result, our operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political conditions and governmental regulations. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the United Kingdom’s June 2016 referendum in which voters approved the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union. We also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars (approximately half of 2018 net sales), which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations. The scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results. In addition, political unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict and disease outbreaks have increased the risks of doing business abroad generally. The uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the U.K. exiting the European Union, and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  The results of a June 2016 referendum vote in the U.K. were in favor of the U.K. exiting the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). On March 29, 2017, the U.K. notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. As a result of this notification, a complex and uncertain process of negotiation is now taking place to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the European Union, with the U.K. currently due to exit the European Union on March 29, 2019. The uncertainty leading up to and following the Brexit referendum has had, and the implementation of Brexit may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and demand for our products in Europe, and particularly in the U.K. The long-term nature of the U.K.’s relationship with the European Union is unclear and there is considerable uncertainty when, or if, any withdrawal agreement or long-term relationship strategy, including trade deals, will be agreed to and implemented by the U.K. and the European Union. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere. In addition, Brexit has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or both of the euro and the British pound sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars). Such a development could have other unpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our flooring products in the U.K. and in Europe if a U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe. Large increases in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers. Petroleum-based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing carpet. Synthetic rubber uses petroleum based products as feedstock as well. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued volatility in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such price increases to our customers. 14Table of Contents Unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole third party supplier for luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) could have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of third party suppliers of synthetic fiber and a single supplier for our LVT products. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon) or sole supplier of LVT, including failure by any third party supplier to meet our product specifications, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products or our own LVT. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately or a shortfall in production by the supplier for reasons unrelated to us, such as work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole supplier of LVT is terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier or developing new supply chain sources for LVT. A prolonged inability on our part to source synthetic fiber included in our products or LVT on a cost-effective basis could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships. If we fail to realize the expected synergies and other benefits of the nora acquisition, our results of operations and stock price may be negatively affected. We recently completed the acquisition of nora, a manufacturer and multinational marketer of resilient rubber floor coverings.  The success of the acquisition will depend substantially on our ability to realize the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the businesses of the Company and nora.  Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks that:  ●we may not be able to successfully combine and integrate the businesses on a timely basis, or at all; ●the integration process could divert management’s attention, cause employee or customer attrition or cause other disruption; ●nora may not contribute to the revenues and profitability of the combined business as much as we currently expect; or ●we may not be able to manage the increased indebtedness we have incurred in connection with the acquisition. If we are not able to successfully combine the businesses of the Company and nora within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected synergies and other benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the results of our operations or value of our common stock may be adversely affected. It is also possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or customers of the Company or nora, the disruption of the companies’ ongoing businesses or in unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-closing integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the operations of the Company and nora. It is possible that the integration process could result in:  ●diversion of management’s attention; ●the lack of personnel or other resources to pursue other potential business opportunities; and ●the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies. Any of these consequences could adversely affect each company’s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or their ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, or could reduce each company’s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company and the value of our common stock.  We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could have important negative consequences to us. Our significant indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including:  ●making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness; ●increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions; 15Table of Contents  ●limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements; ●requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements; ●limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; ●placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and ●limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures. It is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness. As a consequence of our level of indebtedness, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service requirements. In addition, borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expenses will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase. The terms of our Syndicated Credit Facility also limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations, consummate certain asset sales, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, create liens, merge or consolidate with any other person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. They also require us to comply with certain other reporting, affirmative and negative covenants and meet certain financial tests. If we fail to satisfy these tests or comply with these covenants, a default may occur, in which case the lenders could accelerate the debt as well as any other debt to which cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions apply. Our Syndicated Credit Facility matures in August 2023. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate, refinance or otherwise obtain the necessary funds to satisfy these obligations. If we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing, we would have to consider other options, such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs, or using cash, if available, that would have been used for other business purposes. On July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (“LIBOR”), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021, and LIBOR may be discontinued or modified by 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) in April 2018 as an alternative for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to SOFR or another benchmark rate may occur over the course of the next few years. We have exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments, namely our floating rate Syndicated Credit Facility. This facility allows for the use of an alternative benchmark rate if LIBOR is no longer available. At this time, we cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline. The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward. Our earnings in a future period could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, if a future test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets. As prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. In the past, we have had non-cash adjustments for goodwill impairment as a result of such testings ($61.2 million in 2008 and $44.5 million in 2007). A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period. Changes to our facilities could disrupt our operations. From time to time, we make improvements to our physical facilities, or move operations to new ones. Large scale changes or moves could disrupt our normal operations, leading to possible loss of productivity, which may adversely affect our results. 16Table of Contents We are also making significant investments and modifications to our manufacturing facilities, particularly in LaGrange, Georgia. At times this process can be disruptive, and there is no guarantee that these efforts will yield the financial returns and improvements in the business that we hope to achieve from them. In addition, while these changes are intended to yield stronger financial results, they could potentially adversely affect financial results due to project delays, business disruption as new facilities and equipment come online, and general disruption as we make changes and modifications to our manufacturing facilities and processes. Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events. While we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our manufacturing facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customers’ facilities. For example, in July 2012, a fire occurred at our manufacturing facility in Picton, Australia, causing extensive damage and rendering the facility inoperable. In January 2014, we commenced operations at a new manufacturing facility in Minto, Australia. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions to or failures of our information technology systems could adversely effect on our business. We rely heavily on information technology systems—both software and computer hardware—to operate our business. We rely on these systems to, among other things:  ●facilitate and plan the purchase, management and distribution of, and payment for, inventory and raw materials; ●control our production processes; ●manage and monitor our distribution network and logistics; ●receive, process and ship orders; ●manage billing, collections and payables; ●manage financial reporting; and ●manage payroll and human resources information. Our IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including: ●natural disasters, like fires; ●power loss; ●software “bugs”, hardware defects or human error; or ●hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other cyber attacks. Any of these events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations. These disruptions may lead to production or shipping stoppages, which may in turn lead to material revenue loss and reputational harm. There is no guarantee that our backup systems or disaster recovery procedures will be adequate to mitigate losses due to IT system disruptions in a timely fashion, and we may incur significant expense in correcting IT system emergencies. To the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including about our employees or other individuals, security breaches may expose us to other serious liabilities and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In addition, as cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated, the costs to defend and insure against cyberattacks can be expected to rise. "

RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock.  Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. Sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country’s or region’s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. The effects of cyclicality upon the corporate office segment tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the institutional segment. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other market. The effects of cyclicality upon the new construction segment of the market also tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are weakened. We compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do.  We may face challenges competing on price, making investments in our business or on product design. The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry.  Moreover, some of our competitors are adding manufacturing capacity into the industry throughout the globe which could increase the amount of supply in the market.  Increased capacity at our competitors could result in pricing pressure on our products (including products, like LVT, which may currently carry attractive margins) and less demand for our products, thus adversely affecting both revenues and profitability. Some of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do.  Competing effectively may require us to make additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities.   In addition, we often compete on design preferences.  Our customers’ design preferences may evolve or change before we adapt quickly enough to those changes or before we recognize those changes have happened in the marketplace. If this occurs, it could negatively affect our sales as our customers choose other product offerings. Our success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives, our principal design consultant and other key personnel (including sales personnel), and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our agreement with David Oakey Designs can be terminated by either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. Our business also depends on the recruitment and retention of other key personnel, including strong sales leaders. We may lose the services of key personnel for a variety of reasons, including if our compensation programs become uncompetitive in the relevant markets for our employees and service providers, or if the Company undergoes significant disruptive change (including not only economic downturns, but potentially changes management believes are positive in the long term). The loss of key personnel with a great deal of knowledge, training and experience in the carpet industry – particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management – could have an adverse impact on our business. We may not be able to easily replace such personnel, particularly if the underlying reasons for the loss make the Company relatively unattractive as an employer. We are implementing a multi-year transformation of our sales organization, including the implementation of standardized processes in which our sales force goes to market, interacts with customers, works with the architect and design community and, in general, operates day-to-day.  We are also implementing technology tools that the sales force will be required to use as part of their day-to-day jobs, and new management positions to actively manage and coach the sales force.  All of these changes are disruptive, which may create challenges for our sales force to adapt, particularly for long tenured employees, which comprise a large portion of our sales force.  There are no guarantees that these efforts will increase sales or improve profitability of the business, or that they will not instead adversely disrupt the business, decrease sales, and decrease overall profitability. Our substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations. We have substantial international operations. In 2017, approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our corporate strategy includes the expansion and growth of our international business on a worldwide basis. As a result, our operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political conditions and governmental regulations. This includes, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the United Kingdom’s June 2016 referendum in which voters approved the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union. We also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars (approximately half of 2017 net sales), which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations. The scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results. In addition, political unrest, terrorist acts, military conflict and disease outbreaks have increased the risks of doing business abroad generally.  13Table of Contents Concerns regarding European sovereign debt and market perceptions about the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone, the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, or the U.K. exiting the European Union, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Following the European sovereign debt crisis that began in 2011, concerns still persist regarding the debt burden of certain countries using the euro as their currency (the “Eurozone”) and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. Despite remedial efforts undertaken by the European Commission and others, these concerns have caused instability in the euro and could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations or increase the risks of foreign currency fluctuations or cause the failure of hedging programs intended to reduce those risks. In addition, concerns over these effects on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally, and more specifically on our ability and the ability of our customers, suppliers and lenders to finance our and their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies and materials, and on the demand for our products. In addition, the results of a June 2016 referendum vote in the U.K. were in favor of the U.K. exiting the European Union (the “Brexit Vote”).  On March 29, 2017, the U.K. notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The terms of the withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period that could last at least two years from the withdrawal notification date.  The uncertainty leading up to and following the Brexit Vote has had a negative impact on our business and demand for our products in Europe, and particularly in the U.K.  In addition, the Brexit Vote has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or both of the euro and the British Pound Sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars).  Such a development could have other unpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our carpet products in the U.K. and in Europe if a U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe. Large increases in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers. Petroleum-based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued volatility in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such price increases to our customers. Unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole third party supplier for luxury vinyl tile (“LVT”) could have a material adverse effect on us. We depend on a small number of third party suppliers of synthetic fiber and a single supplier for our LVT products. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon) or sole supplier of LVT, including failure by any third party supplier to meet our product specifications, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products or our own LVT. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately or a shortfall in production by the supplier for reasons unrelated to us, such as work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole supplier of LVT is terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier or developing new supply chain sources for LVT. A prolonged inability on our part to source synthetic fiber included in our products or LVT on a cost-effective basis could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could have important negative consequences to us. Our significant indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including:  •making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness;  •increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;  •limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;  •requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;  •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  •placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and  •limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures. 14Table of Contents As a consequence of our level of indebtedness, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service requirements. In addition, borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expenses will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase. The terms of our Syndicated Credit Facility also limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations, consummate certain asset sales, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, create liens, merge or consolidate with any other person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. They also require us to comply with certain other reporting, affirmative and negative covenants and meet certain financial tests. If we fail to satisfy these tests or comply with these covenants, a default may occur, in which case the lenders could accelerate the debt as well as any other debt to which cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions apply. Our Syndicated Credit Facility matures in August 2022. We cannot assure you that we would be able to renegotiate, refinance or otherwise obtain the necessary funds to satisfy these obligations. It is important for you to consider that we have a significant amount of indebtedness. We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to refinance our debt or obtain new financing, we would have to consider other options, such as selling assets to meet our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs, or using cash, if available, that would have been used for other business purposes. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline. The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward. Our earnings in a future period could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, if a future test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets. As prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. In the past, we have had non-cash adjustments for goodwill impairment as a result of such testings ($61.2 million in 2008 and $44.5 million in 2007). A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period. Changes to our facilities could disrupt our operations. From time to time, we make improvements to our physical facilities, or move operations to new ones.  Large scale changes or moves could disrupt our normal operations, leading to possible loss of productivity, which may adversely affect our results. The company will be moving its corporate headquarters in 2018. The transition and relocation of the company’s headquarters could be disruptive and could create a distraction to management in running day-to-day operations which could adversely affect the business. We are also making significant investments and modifications to our manufacturing facilities in LaGrange Georgia. At times this process can be disruptive, and there is no guarantee that these efforts will yield the financial returns and improvements in the business that we hope to achieve from them. In addition, while these changes are intended to yield stronger financial results, they could potentially adversely affect financial results due to project delays, business disruption as new facilities and equipment come online, and general disruption as we make changes and modifications to our manufacturing facilities and processes. Our business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire or other unexpected events. While we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our manufacturing facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customers’ facilities. For example, in July 2012, a fire occurred at our manufacturing facility in Picton, Australia, causing extensive damage and rendering the facility inoperable. In January 2014, we commenced operations at a new manufacturing facility in Minto, Australia. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and/or suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Disruptions to or failures of our information technology systems could adversely effect on our business. We rely heavily on information technology systems—both software and computer hardware—to operate our business. We rely on these systems to, among other things:  ●facilitate and plan the purchase, management and distribution of, and payment for, inventory and raw materials; ●Control our production processes; ●manage and monitor our distribution network and logistics; ●receive, process and ship orders; ●manage billing, collections and payables; ●manage financial reporting; and  ●manage payroll and human resources information. 15Table of Contents Our IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including: ●natural disasters, like fires; ●power loss; ●software “bugs”, hardware defects or human error; or ●hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware or other cyber attacks. Any of these events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations. These disruptions may lead to production or shipping stoppages, which may in turn lead to material revenue loss and reputational harm. There is no guarantee that our backup systems or disaster recovery procedures will be adequate to mitigate losses due to IT system disruptions in a timely fashion, and we may incur significant expense in correcting IT system emergencies. To the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including about our employees, security breaches may expose us to other serious liabilities and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In addition, as cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated, the costs to defend and insure against cyberattacks can be expected to rise. Our Rights Agreement could discourage tender offers or other transactions for our stock that could result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our stock. Our Board of Directors has adopted a Rights Agreement pursuant to which holders of our common stock will be entitled to purchase from us a fraction of a share of our Series B Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock if a third party acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock without our consent. In addition, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to purchase the stock of an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) at a discount upon the occurrence of triggering events. These provisions of the Rights Agreement could have the effect of discouraging tender offers or other transactions that could result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock.  "

8,TILE,INTERFACE INC,2016-03-02,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock. Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. Sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country’s or region’s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. The effects of cyclicality upon the corporate office segment tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the institutional segment. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other market. The effects of cyclicality upon the new construction segment of the market also tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are further weakened.   12Table Of Contents  We compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do. The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. Some of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do. Competing effectively may require us to make additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities. Competitive forces may also result in pricing pressures, decreased demand for our products and the loss of market share. Our success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives and our principal design consultant, and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our current agreement with David Oakey Designs extends to August 2017. The loss of any of these key persons could have an adverse impact on our business because each has a great deal of knowledge, training and experience in the carpet industry – particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management – and could not easily or quickly be replaced. Our substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations. We have substantial international operations. In 2015, approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our corporate strategy includes the expansion and growth of our international business on a worldwide basis. As a result, our operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political conditions and governmental regulations. We also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars (approximately half of 2015 net sales), which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations. The scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results. Concerns regarding the European sovereign debt crisis and market perceptions about the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone, the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, or the possibility of the U.K. exiting the European Union, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Following the European sovereign debt crisis that began in 2011, concerns still persist regarding the debt burden of certain countries using the euro as their currency (the “Eurozone”) and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. Despite remedial efforts undertaken by the European Commission and others, these concerns have caused instability in the euro and could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations or increase the risks of foreign currency fluctuations or cause the failure of hedging programs intended to reduce those risks. In addition, concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally, and more specifically on our ability and the ability of our customers, suppliers and lenders to finance our and their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies and materials, and on the demand for our products. In addition, in June 2016, a referendum will take place in the U.K. as to whether or not the U.K. should remain a member of the European Union. In the event of a decision by the U.K. to exit the European Union, there could be a detrimental effect on the value of either or both of the Euro and the British Pound Sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars). Such a development could have other unpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our carpet products in Europe if a U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe.   13Table Of Contents  Large increases in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers. Petroleum-based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued volatility in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such price increases to our customers. Unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber could have a material adverse effect on us. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon) could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products.  If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber is terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier. The worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The worldwide financial and credit crisis, which began in 2008 and continued in varying degrees for several years thereafter, has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many business operations worldwide.  This shortage of liquidity and credit, combined with substantial losses in worldwide equity markets, could lead to a worldwide economic recession and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Specifically, the limited availability of credit and liquidity adversely affects the ability of customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations.  Consequently, customers may defer, delay or cancel renovation and construction projects where our carpet is used, resulting in decreased orders and sales for us, and they also may not be able to pay us for those products and services we already have provided to them.  For the same reasons, suppliers may not be able to produce and deliver raw materials and other goods and services that we have ordered from them, thus disrupting our own manufacturing operations.  In addition, our ability to obtain funding from capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets.  This inability to obtain that funding could prevent us from pursuing important strategic growth plans, from reacting to changing economic and business conditions, and from refinancing existing debt (which in turn could lead to a default on our debt).  The financial and credit crisis also could have an impact on the lenders under our credit facilities, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to provide us with loans and letters of credit, which are important sources of liquidity for us. Our Syndicated Credit Facility matures in October 2019.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance this debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, especially given the effects of the worldwide financial and credit crisis. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could have important negative consequences to us. Our significant indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including:  •making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness;  •increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;  •limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;  •requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;  •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;  •placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and  •limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures. As a consequence of our level of indebtedness, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service requirements.

A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period. Our Rights Agreement could discourage tender offers or other transactions for our stock that could result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our stock. Our Board of Directors has adopted a Rights Agreement pursuant to which holders of our common stock will be entitled to purchase from us a fraction of a share of our Series B Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock if a third party acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock without our consent. In addition, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to purchase the stock of an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) at a discount upon the occurrence of triggering events. These provisions of the Rights Agreement could have the effect of discouraging tender offers or other transactions that could result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock.  "

Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Sales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. Sales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country’s or region’s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. The effects of cyclicality upon the corporate office segment tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the institutional segment. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other market. The effects of cyclicality upon the new construction segment of the market also tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are further weakened. We compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do. The floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. Some of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do. Our success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives and our principal design consultant, and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely. We believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our current agreement with David Oakey Designs extends to August 2017. The loss of any of these key persons could have an adverse impact on our business because each has a great deal of knowledge, training and experience in the carpet industry – particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management – and could not easily or quickly be replaced.  12 Our substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations. We have substantial international operations. In 2013, approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our corporate strategy includes the expansion and growth of our international business on a worldwide basis. As a result, our operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties, including risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political conditions and governmental regulations. We also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars (approximately half of 2013 net sales), which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations. The scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results. The worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The worldwide financial and credit crisis, which began in 2008 and continued in varying degrees for several years thereafter, has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many business operations worldwide.  This shortage of liquidity and credit, combined with substantial losses in worldwide equity markets, could lead to a worldwide economic recession and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Specifically, the limited availability of credit and liquidity adversely affects the ability of customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations.  Consequently, customers may defer, delay or cancel renovation and construction projects where our carpet is used, resulting in decreased orders and sales for us, and they also may not be able to pay us for those products and services we already have provided to them.  For the same reasons, suppliers may not be able to produce and deliver raw materials and other goods and services that we have ordered from them, thus disrupting our own manufacturing operations.  In addition, our ability to obtain funding from capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets.  This inability to obtain that funding could prevent us from pursuing important strategic growth plans, from reacting to changing economic and business conditions, and from refinancing existing debt (which in turn could lead to a default on our debt).  The financial and credit crisis also could have an impact on the lenders under our credit facilities, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to provide us with loans and letters of credit, which are important sources of liquidity for us. Our Syndicated Credit Facility matures in October 2018 and our 7.625% Senior Notes mature in December 2018.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance this debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, especially given the effects of the worldwide financial and credit crisis.  Concerns regarding the European sovereign debt crisis and market perceptions about the instability of the euro, the potential re-introduction of individual currencies within the Eurozone, or the potential dissolution of the euro entirely, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Following the European sovereign debt crisis that began in 2011, concerns still persist regarding the debt burden of certain countries using the euro as their currency (the “Eurozone”) and their ability to meet future financial obligations, the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries. Despite remedial efforts undertaken by the European Commission and others, these concerns have caused instability in the euro and could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries, or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations or increase the risks of foreign currency fluctuations or cause the failure of hedging programs intended to reduce those risks. In addition, concerns over the effect of this financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have an adverse impact on the capital markets generally, and more specifically on our ability and the ability of our customers, suppliers and lenders to finance our and their respective businesses, to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies and materials, and on the demand for our products.  Large increases in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers. Petroleum-based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued volatility in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such price increases to our customers. Unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber could have a material adverse effect on us. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon), which typically are not pursuant to long-term agreements, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products.  If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber is terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier. We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could have important negative consequences to us. Our significant indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including:  •making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness;  •increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions;  •limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;  •requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements;  •limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; 13    •placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and  •limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures. As a consequence of our level of indebtedness, a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to debt service requirements. In addition, the terms of our Syndicated Credit Facility and the indenture governing our 7.625% Senior Notes due 2018 limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations, consummate certain asset sales, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, create liens, merge or consolidate with any other person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. They also require us to comply with certain other reporting, affirmative and negative covenants and meet certain financial tests. If we fail to satisfy these tests or comply with these covenants, a default may occur, in which case the lenders could accelerate the debt as well as any other debt to which cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions apply. We cannot assure you that we would be able to renegotiate, refinance or otherwise obtain the necessary funds to satisfy these obligations. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline. The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward. Our earnings in a future period could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, if a future test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets. As prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. In the past, we have had non-cash adjustments for goodwill impairment as a result of such testings ($61.2 million in 2008 and $44.5 million in 2007). A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period. Our Rights Agreement could discourage tender offers or other transactions for our stock that could result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our stock. Our Board of Directors has adopted a Rights Agreement pursuant to which holders of our common stock will be entitled to purchase from us a fraction of a share of our Series B Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock if a third party acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock without our consent. In addition, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to purchase the stock of an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) at a discount upon the occurrence of triggering events. These provisions of the Rights Agreements could have the effect of discouraging tender offers or other transactions that could result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock.  "

Any or    all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse    effect on our business, financial condition, results of    operations and prospects. General    Business Risks The    ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and    results of operations.     The ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced    the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the    continuation and expansion of many business operations    worldwide. This shortage of liquidity and credit, combined with    recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets, could    lead to an extended worldwide economic recession and result in a    material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and    results of operations. Specifically, the limited availability of    credit and liquidity adversely affects the ability of customers    and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and    operations. Consequently, customers may defer, delay or cancel    renovation and construction projects where our carpet is used,    resulting in decreased orders and sales for us, and they also    may not be able to pay us for those products and services we    already have provided to them. For the same reasons, suppliers    may not be able to produce and deliver raw materials and other    goods and services that we have ordered from them, thus    disrupting our own manufacturing operations. In addition, our    ability to obtain funding from capital markets may be severely    restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access    those markets. This inability to obtain that funding could    prevent us from pursuing important strategic growth plans, from    reacting to changing economic and business conditions, and from    refinancing existing debt (which in turn could lead to a default    on our debt). The financial and credit crisis also could have an    impact on the lenders under our credit facilities, causing them    to fail to meet their obligations to provide us with loans and    letters of credit, which are important sources of liquidity for    us.     Our domestic revolving credit facility matures in December 2012.    We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or    refinance this debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all,    especially given the ongoing worldwide financial and credit    crisis. Sales    of our principal products have been and may continue to be    affected by adverse economic cycles in the renovation and    construction of commercial and institutional    buildings.     Sales of our principal products are related to the renovation    and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This    activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a    countrys or regions general economy, prevailing    interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control    measures by businesses and other users of commercial or    institutional space. The effects of cyclicality upon the    corporate office segment tend to be more pronounced than the    effects upon the institutional segment. Historically, we have    generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any    other market. The effects of cyclicality upon the new    construction segment of the market also tend to be more    pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment. These    effects may recur and could be more pronounced if the current    global economic conditions do not improve or are further    weakened. We    compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly    competitive commercial floorcovering products market, and some    of these competitors have greater financial resources than we    do.     The commercial floorcovering industry is highly competitive.    Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with    other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of    floorcovering.

Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product    design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive    consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our    current agreement with David Oakey Designs extends to April    2011. The loss of any of these key persons could have an adverse    impact on our business because each has a great deal of    knowledge, training and experience in the carpet industry     particularly in the areas of sales, marketing,    operations, product design and management  and could    not easily or quickly be replaced. Our    substantial international operations are subject to various    political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely    affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation    or other government regulation and by foreign currency    fluctuations.     We have substantial international operations. In 2010,    approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of    our production were outside the United States, primarily in    Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our corporate strategy includes the    expansion and growth of our international business on a    worldwide basis. As a result, our operations are subject to    various political, economic and other uncertainties, including    risks of restrictive taxation policies, changing political    conditions and governmental regulations.

In addition, the terms of our primary    revolving credit facility in the U.S. and the indenture    governing our    75/8% Senior    Notes due 2018 limit our ability and the ability of our    subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional    indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other restricted    payments or investments in certain situations, consummate    certain asset sales, enter into certain transactions with    affiliates, create liens, merge or consolidate with any other    person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise    dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.

Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year,    unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by    applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim    testing for possible goodwill impairment. In the past, we have    had non-cash adjustments for goodwill impairment as a result of    such testings ($61.2 million in 2008, $44.5 million in    2007, and $20.7 million in 2006). A future goodwill    impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment,    which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future    period. Our    Chairman, together with other insiders, currently has sufficient    voting power to elect a majority of our Board of    Directors.     Our Chairman, Ray C. Anderson, beneficially owns approximately    47% of our outstanding Class B common stock. The holders of    the Class B common stock are entitled, as a class, to elect    a majority of our Board of Directors. Therefore,    Mr. Anderson, together with other insiders, has sufficient    voting power to elect a majority of the Board of Directors. On    all other matters submitted to the shareholders for a vote, the    holders of the Class B common stock generally vote together    as a single class with the holders of the Class A common    stock.

The effects of cyclicality upon the new construction segment of the market also tend to be more pronounced than the effects upon the renovation segment. The adverse cycle during the years 2001 through 2003 significantly lessened the overall demand for commercial interiors products, which adversely affected our business during those years. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if the current global economic conditions do not improve or are further weakened.The ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of many business operations worldwide.  This shortage of liquidity and credit, combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets, could lead to an extended worldwide economic recession and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Specifically, the limited availability of credit and liquidity adversely affects the ability of customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations.  Consequently, customers may defer, delay or cancel renovation and construction projects where our carpet is used, resulting in decreased orders and sales for us, and they also may not be able to pay us for those products and services we already have provided to them.  For the same reasons, suppliers may not be able to produce and deliver raw materials and other goods and services that we have ordered from them, thus disrupting our own manufacturing operations.  In addition, our ability to obtain funding from capital markets may be severely restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to access those markets.  This inability to obtain that funding could prevent us from pursuing important strategic growth plans, from reacting to changing economic and business conditions, and from refinancing existing debt (which in turn could lead to a default on our debt).  The financial and credit crisis also could have an impact on the lenders under our credit facilities, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to provide us with loans and letters of credit, which are important sources of liquidity for us.Our domestic revolving credit facility matures in December 2012, our outstanding 11 3/8% Senior Secured Notes mature in November 2013, and our outstanding 9.5% Senior Subordinated Notes mature in February 2014.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to renegotiate or refinance any of this debt on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, especially given the ongoing worldwide financial and credit crisis.   13  We compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive commercial floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do.The commercial floorcovering industry is highly competitive.

While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued volatility in the cost of petroleum-based raw materials could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such price increases to our customers.Unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber could have a material adverse effect on us.The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon), which typically are not pursuant to long-term agreements, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products.  If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber is terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier.  14  We have a significant amount of indebtedness, which could have important negative consequences to us.Our significant indebtedness could have important negative consequences to us, including:·    making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to such indebtedness; ·    increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions; ·    limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements; ·    requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to interest and principal payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other growth initiatives, and other general corporate requirements; ·    limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; ·    placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and ·    limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures. The terms of our primary revolving credit facility in the U.S. and the indentures governing our 9.5% Senior Subordinated Notes  due 2014 and our 11 3/8% Senior Secured Notes due 2013 govern our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments or investments in certain situations, consummate certain asset sales, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, create liens, merge or consolidate with any other person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets.  They also require us to comply with certain other reporting, affirmative and negative covenants and, at times, meet certain financial tests.  If we fail to satisfy these tests or comply with these covenants, a default may occur, in which case the lenders could accelerate the debt as well as any other debt to which cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions apply.  We cannot assure you that we would be able to renegotiate, refinance or otherwise obtain the necessary funds to satisfy these obligations. The market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline.The market price of our Class A common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward.Our earnings in a future period could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, if a future test of goodwill assets indicates a material impairment of those assets.As prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. In the past, we have had non-cash adjustments for goodwill impairment as a result of such testings ($61.2 million in 2008, $44.5 million in 2007, and $20.7 million in 2006). A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period.Our Chairman currently has sufficient voting power to elect a majority of our Board of Directors.Our Chairman, Ray C. Anderson, beneficially owns approximately 54% of our outstanding Class B common stock. The holders of the Class B common stock are entitled, as a class, to elect a majority of our Board of Directors. Therefore, Mr. Anderson has sufficient voting power to elect a majority of the Board of Directors. On all other matters submitted to the shareholders for a vote, the holders of the Class B common stock generally vote together as a single class with the holders of the Class A common stock. Mr. Anderson’s beneficial ownership of the outstanding Class A and Class B common stock combined is approximately 6%.  15  Our Rights Agreement could discourage tender offers or other transactions for our stock that could result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our stock.Our Board of Directors has adopted a Rights Agreement pursuant to which holders of our common stock will be entitled to purchase from us a fraction of a share of our Series B Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock if a third party acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our common stock without our consent. In addition, the holders of our common stock will be entitled to purchase the stock of an Acquiring Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) at a discount upon the occurrence of triggering events. These provisions of the Rights Agreements could have the effect of discouraging tender offers or other transactions that could result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for our common stock"
