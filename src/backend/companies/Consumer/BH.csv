1,BH,BIGLARI HOLDINGS INC,2024-02-26,"    Risk Factors
Biglari Holdings and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our,” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in their business operations, which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations.Risks relating to Biglari HoldingsWe are dependent on our Chairman and CEO.Our success depends on the services of Sardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. All major investment and capital allocation decisions are made for the Company and its subsidiaries by Mr. Biglari. If for any reason the services of Mr. Biglari were to become unavailable, a material adverse effect on our business could occur.Sardar Biglari, Chairman and CEO, beneficially owns over 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, enabling Mr. Biglari to exert control over matters requiring shareholder approval.Mr. Biglari has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, the amendment of our articles of incorporation or bylaws, and other significant transactions. In addition, Mr. Biglari has the ability to control the management and affairs of the Company. This control position may conflict with the interests of some or all of the Company’s passive shareholders, and reduce the possibility of a merger proposal, tender offer, or proxy contest for the removal of directors.We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and thus can rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.Because Mr. Biglari beneficially owns more than 50% of the Company’s outstanding voting stock, we are considered a “controlled company” pursuant to New York Stock Exchange rules. As a result, we are not required to comply with certain director independence and board committee requirements. The Company does not have a governance and nominating committee.Biglari Holdings’ access to capital is subject to restrictions that may adversely affect its ability to satisfy its cash requirements.We are a holding company and are largely dependent upon dividends and other sources of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our needs. The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to Biglari Holdings is regulated by state insurance laws, which limit the amount of, and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of, cash dividends. Furthermore, as a result of our substantial investments in The Lion Fund, L.P., and The Lion Fund II, L.P., investment partnerships controlled by Mr. Biglari, our access to capital is restricted by the terms of their respective partnership agreements. There is also a high likelihood that we will make additional investments in these investment partnerships. Competition and technology may result in lower earnings.Our operating businesses face intense competition within their markets, and many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of their competitive advantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfully enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results may decline in the future. We also highlight certain competitive risks in the sections below.Deterioration of general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings. Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles, which affect the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deterioration of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations.Epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks could hurt our operating businesses and investments.Epidemics, pandemics, or outbreaks may adversely affect our operations and investments. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. 4Table of ContentsPotential changes in laws or regulations may have a negative impact on our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.In prior years, bills have been introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would have prohibited the listing of common stock on a national securities exchange if such common stock were part of a class of securities that has no voting rights or carries disproportionate voting rights. Although these bills have not been acted upon by Congress, there can be no assurance that such a bill (or a modified version thereof) will not be introduced in Congress in the future. Legislation or other regulatory developments could make the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock ineligible for trading on the NYSE or other national securities exchanges.Litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations.We are or may be from time to time a party to various legal actions, investigations, and other proceedings brought by employees, consumers, policyholders, suppliers, shareholders, government agencies, or other third parties in connection with matters pertaining to our business, including those related to our investment activities. The outcome of such matters is often difficult to assess or quantify, and the cost to defend future proceedings may be significant. Even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any allegation regarding the Company, our business, or our products could adversely affect our reputation. While we believe that the ultimate outcome of routine legal proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material impact on our financial position, we cannot assure that an adverse outcome on, or reputational damage from, any of these matters would not, in fact, materially impact our business and results of operations for the period after these matters are completed or otherwise resolved.Risks Relating to Our Restaurant OperationsOur restaurant operations face intense competition from a wide range of industry participants.The restaurant business is one of the most intensely competitive industries. As there are virtually no barriers to entry into the restaurant business, competitors may include national, regional, and local establishments. Restaurant businesses compete on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety, and product quality. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national, regional, and local economic conditions. The performance of individual restaurants may be impacted by factors such as traffic patterns, demographic trends, weather conditions, and competing restaurants. Additional factors that may adversely affect the restaurant industry include, but are not limited to, food and wage inflation, safety, and food-borne illness. Changes in economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our restaurant operations.Our restaurant operations are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the economy in general or the restaurant industry in particular. The restaurant industry has been affected by economic factors, including the deterioration of global, national, regional, and local economic conditions, declines in employment levels, and shifts in consumer spending patterns. Declines in consumer restaurant spending could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations. As a result, decreased cash flow generated from our business may adversely affect our financial position and our ability to fund our operations. In addition, macroeconomic disruptions could adversely impact the availability of financing for our franchisees’ expansions and operations.Fluctuations in commodity and energy prices and the availability of commodities, including beef and dairy, could affect our restaurant business.The cost, availability, and quality of ingredients restaurant operations use to prepare their food are subject to a range of factors, many of which are beyond their control. A significant component of our restaurant business costs is related to food commodities, including beef and dairy products, which can be subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, changes in commodity markets, inflation, and other factors. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these food commodities, our results of operations may be negatively affected. In addition, our restaurants are dependent upon frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet certain specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather, or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality, and cost of ingredients, which would likely lower revenues, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. We cannot predict whether we will continue to be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices, menu offerings, and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results.5Table of ContentsAdverse weather conditions or losses due to casualties could negatively impact our operating performance.Property damage caused by casualties and natural disasters, instances of inclement weather, flooding, hurricanes, fire, and other acts of nature can adversely impact sales in several ways. Many of Steak n Shake’s and Western Sizzlin’s restaurants are located in the Midwest and Southeast portions of the United States. During the first and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Midwest may face harsh winter weather conditions. During the third and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Southeast may experience hurricanes or tropical storms. Our sales and operating results may be negatively affected by these harsh weather conditions, which could make it more difficult for guests to visit our restaurants, necessitate the closure of restaurants, cause physical damage, or lead to a shortage of employees.Changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our restaurant business.Our restaurant business depends substantially on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality staff. Maintaining adequate staffing in our restaurants requires workforce planning and knowledge of the relevant labor market. The market for the most qualified talent continues to be competitive, and we must provide competitive wages, benefits, and workplace conditions. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, challenges in recruiting and retaining associates in various locations. A shortage of qualified candidates, failure to recruit and retain new associates in a timely manner, or higher than expected turnover levels could all affect our ability to grow sales at existing restaurants or meet our labor cost objectives.We are subject to health, employment, environmental, and other government regulations, and failure to comply with existing or future government regulations could expose us to litigation or penalties, damage our reputation, and lower profits.We are subject to various global, federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting our restaurant operations. Changes in existing laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us, or increased enforcement by governmental authorities, may require us to incur additional costs and expenses necessary for compliance. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, we may be subject to governmental action or litigation, and our reputation could be harmed accordingly. Injury to our reputation would, in turn, likely reduce revenues and profits.The development and construction of restaurants is subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. Difficulties in obtaining, or failure to obtain, the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area.Restaurant operations are also subject to regulatory initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food products. The operation of the Steak n Shake and Western Sizzlin franchise systems is also subject to franchise laws and regulations enacted by a number of states, and to rules promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Any future legislation regulating franchise relationships may negatively affect our operations, particularly our relationships with franchisees. Failure to comply with new or existing franchise laws and regulations in any jurisdiction, or to obtain required government approvals, could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales. Further national, state, and local government initiatives, such as mandatory health insurance coverage or increases in minimum wage rates, could adversely affect our business.Risks Relating to Our Investment ActivitiesThe majority of our investment activities are conducted through outside investment partnerships, The Lion Fund, L.P., and The Lion Fund II, L.P., which are controlled by Mr. Biglari.Our investment activities are conducted mainly through these outside investment partnerships. Under the terms of their partnership agreements, each contribution made by the Company to the investment partnerships is subject to a five-year lock-up period, and any distribution upon our withdrawal of funds will be paid out over a two-year period (and may be paid in-kind rather than in cash, thus increasing the difficulty of liquidating these investments). As a result of these provisions and our consequent inability to access this capital for a defined period, the capital we have invested in the investment partnerships may be subject to an increased risk of loss of all or a significant portion of its value, and we may become unable to meet our capital requirements. There is a high likelihood that we will make additional investments in these investment partnerships in the future.We have a services agreement with Biglari Capital Corp., the general partner of the investment partnerships (“Biglari Capital”), and Biglari Enterprises LLC (collectively, the “Biglari Entities”), in which the Company pays a fixed fee to the Biglari Entities for business and administrative-related services. The Biglari Entities are owned by Mr. Biglari. There can be no assurance that the fees paid will be commensurate with the benefits received.The incentive allocation to which Mr. Biglari, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Capital, is entitled with respect to our investments under the terms of the respective partnership agreements is equal to 25% of the net profits allocated to the limited partners in excess of a 6% hurdle rate over the previous high-water mark.6Table of ContentsOur investments may be concentrated, and fair values are subject to a loss in value.The majority of our investments are held through the investment partnerships, which generally invest in common stocks. These investments may be largely concentrated in the common stocks of a few investees. A significant decline in the values of these investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share and earnings.We are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.We run the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company, which would require us to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive, and potentially adverse regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends, and transactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which we operate our business, nor are registered investment companies permitted to have many of the relationships that we have with our affiliated companies.To avoid becoming and registering as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we operate as an ongoing enterprise, with approximately 2,500 employees, along with an asset base from which to pursue acquisitions. Furthermore, Section 3(c)(3) of the Investment Company Act excludes insurance companies from the definition of “investment company.” Because we monitor the value of our investments and structure transactions accordingly, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions due to those concerns. In addition, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of certain of our operating subsidiaries, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, could result in our inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period in which it was established that we were an unregistered investment company.Risks Relating to Our Insurance BusinessOur success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders.Our results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for risks assumed. A primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses.Our insurance business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance business faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, and other catastrophic events. These events typically increase the frequency and severity of commercial property claims. Because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations, and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in significant volatility in our insurance business’s financial condition and results of operations from period to period. We attempt to manage our exposure to these events through reinsurance programs, although there is no assurance we will be successful in doing so.Our insurance business is subject to extensive existing state, local, and foreign governmental regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues.Our insurance business is subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations may relate to, among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital and reserves that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be held. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments. Accordingly, existing or new regulations related to these or other matters, or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance business, may adversely impact its results of operations.7Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our Brand Licensing BusinessLicensing opportunities for the Maxim brand may be difficult to maintain.Maxim’s success depends to a significant degree upon licensing agreements. These licensing agreements mature from time to time, and we may be unable to secure favorable terms for future licensing arrangements. Future licensing partners may also fail to honor their contractual obligations or take other actions that can diminish the value of the Maxim brand. Disputes could arise that prevent or delay our ability to collect licensing revenues under these arrangements. If any of these developments occur or our licensing efforts are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of the Maxim brand, as well as the prospects of our media business, could be materially, adversely affected.Risks Relating to Our Oil and Gas BusinessOur oil and gas business is exposed to the effects of volatile commodity prices.The single largest variable that affects our oil and gas results of operations is the price of crude oil and natural gas. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our oil and gas business’s revenue and profitability. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil or natural gas can have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Our oil and gas business is subject to disruption by factors beyond its control.Any disruption of the extractive business of either of our oil and gas subsidiaries would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our oil and gas operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond their control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, and other forms of system failures, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.Our oil and gas business can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.Our oil and gas operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory, and political environments. Litigation or changes in national, state, or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and natural gas, could adversely affect our operations and profitability"

There is no assurance that our international operations will remain profitable. Our international operations are subject to all of the risks associated with our domestic operations, as well as a number of additional risks, varying substantially country by country. These include, inter alia, international economic and political conditions, corruption, terrorism, social and ethnic unrest, foreign currency fluctuations, differing cultures, and consumer preferences. In addition, we may become subject to foreign governmental regulations that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations, and 4Table of Contentsapplicable local laws. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business and our financial condition.Epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses and investments.The outbreak of COVID-19 adversely affected our operations and investments, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics, or outbreaks may do the same. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors.

These regulations may relate to, among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital and reserves that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be held. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments. Accordingly, existing or new regulations related to these or other matters, or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance business, may adversely impact its results of operations.7Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our Brand Licensing BusinessLicensing opportunities for the Maxim brand may be difficult to maintain.Maxim’s success depends to a significant degree upon licensing agreements. These licensing agreements mature from time to time, and we may be unable to secure favorable terms for future licensing arrangements. Future licensing partners may also fail to honor their contractual obligations or take other actions that can diminish the value of the Maxim brand. Disputes could arise that prevent or delay our ability to collect licensing revenues under these arrangements. If any of these developments occur or our licensing efforts are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of the Maxim brand, as well as the prospects of our media business, could be materially, adversely affected.Risks Relating to Our Oil and Gas BusinessOur oil and gas business is exposed to the effects of volatile commodity prices.The single largest variable that affects our oil and gas results of operations is the price of crude oil and natural gas. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our oil and gas business’s revenue and profitability. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil or natural gas can have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Our oil and gas business is subject to disruption by factors beyond its control.Any disruption of the extractive business of either of our oil and gas subsidiaries would adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our oil and gas operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond their control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, and other forms of system failures, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.Our oil and gas business can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.Our oil and gas operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory, and political environments. Litigation or changes in national, state, or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and natural gas, could adversely affect our operations and profitability"
5,BH,BIGLARI HOLDINGS INC,2022-02-28,"    Risk Factors
Biglari Holdings and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our,” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertainties in their business operations, which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations.Risks relating to Biglari HoldingsWe are dependent on our Chairman and CEO.Our success depends on the services of Sardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. All major investment and capital allocation decisions are made for the Company and its subsidiaries by Mr. Biglari. If for any reason the services of Mr. Biglari were to become unavailable, a material adverse effect on our business could occur.Sardar Biglari, Chairman and CEO, beneficially owns over 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, enabling Mr. Biglari to exert control over matters requiring shareholder approval.Mr. Biglari has the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, the amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, and other significant transactions. In addition, Mr. Biglari has the ability to control the management and affairs of the Company. This control position may conflict with the interests of some or all of the Company’s passive shareholders, and reduce the possibility of a merger proposal, tender offer, or proxy contest for the removal of directors.We are a “controlled company” within the meaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and thus can rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.Because Mr. Biglari beneficially owns more than 50% of the Company’s outstanding voting stock, we are considered a “controlled company” pursuant to New York Stock Exchange rules. As a result, we are not required to comply with certain director independence and board committee requirements. The Company does not have a governance and nominating committee.Biglari Holdings’ access to capital is subject to restrictions that may adversely affect its ability to satisfy its cash requirements or implement its growth strategy.We are a holding company and are largely dependent upon dividends and other sources of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our needs.  The ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to Biglari Holdings is regulated by state insurance laws, which limit the amount of, and in certain circumstances may prohibit the payment of, cash dividends. Furthermore, as a result of our substantial investments in The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P., investment partnerships controlled by Mr. Biglari, our access to capital is restricted by the terms of their respective partnership agreements. There is also a high likelihood that we will make additional investments in these investment partnerships. Competition.Each of our operating businesses faces intense competitive pressure within the markets in which they operate. Competition may arise domestically as well as internationally. Accordingly, future operating results will depend to some degree on whether our operating units are successful in protecting or enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating results may decline from current levels in the future. We also highlight certain competitive risks in the sections below.Deterioration of general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings. Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles, which affect the general economy or the specific industries in which they operate. Significant deterioration of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce a material adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations.Our operating businesses face a variety of risks associated with doing business in foreign markets.                                                                                                                                           There is no assurance that our international operations will remain profitable. Our international operations are subject to all of the risks associated with our domestic operations, as well as a number of additional risks, varying substantially country by country. These include, inter alia, international economic and political conditions, corruption, terrorism, social and ethnic unrest, foreign currency fluctuations, differing cultures, and consumer preferences. In addition, we may become subject to foreign governmental regulations that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations, and 4Table of Contentsapplicable local laws. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could harm our business and our financial condition.Epidemics, pandemics, or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses and investments.The outbreak of COVID-19 adversely affected our operations and investments, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics, or outbreaks may do the same. This is or may be due to closures or restrictions requested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for our products and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, and volatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. Potential changes in laws or regulations may have a negative impact on our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.In prior years, bills have been introduced in Congress that, if enacted, would have prohibited the listing of common stock on a national securities exchange if such common stock were part of a class of securities that has no voting rights or carries disproportionate voting rights. Although these bills have not been acted upon by Congress, there can be no assurance that such a bill (or a modified version thereof) will not be introduced in Congress in the future. Legislation or other regulatory developments could make the shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock ineligible for trading on the NYSE or other national securities exchanges.Litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows, and results of operations.We are or may be from time to time a party to various legal actions, investigations, and other proceedings brought by employees, consumers, policyholders, suppliers, shareholders, government agencies, or other third parties in connection with matters pertaining to our business, including those related to our investment activities. The outcome of such matters is often difficult to assess or quantify, and the cost to defend future proceedings may be significant. Even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any negative allegation regarding our Company, our business, or our products could adversely affect our reputation. While we believe that the ultimate outcome of routine legal proceedings, individually and in the aggregate will not have a material impact on our financial position, we cannot assure that an adverse outcome on, or reputational damage from, any of these matters would not, in fact, materially impact our business and results of operations for the period after these matters are completed or otherwise resolved.Risks Relating to Our Restaurant OperationsOur restaurant operations face intense competition from a wide range of industry participants.The restaurant business is one of the most intensely competitive industries. As there are virtually no barriers to entry into the restaurant business, competitors may include national, regional, and local establishments. Restaurant businesses compete on the basis of price, convenience, service, experience, menu variety, and product quality. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national, regional, and local economic conditions. The performance of individual restaurants may be impacted by factors such as traffic patterns, demographic trends, weather conditions, and competing restaurants. Additional factors that may adversely affect the restaurant industry include, but are not limited to, food and wage inflation, safety, and food-borne illness. Changes in economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our restaurant operations.Our restaurant operations are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the economy in general or the restaurant industry in particular. The restaurant industry has been affected by economic factors, including the deterioration of global, national, regional and local economic conditions, declines in employment levels, and shifts in consumer spending patterns. Declines in consumer restaurant spending could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations. As a result, decreased cash flow generated from our business may adversely affect our financial position and our ability to fund our operations. In addition, macroeconomic disruptions could adversely impact the availability of financing for our franchisees’ expansions and operations.Fluctuations in commodity and energy prices and the availability of commodities, including beef and dairy, could affect our restaurant business.The cost, availability, and quality of ingredients restaurant operations use to prepare their food are subject to a range of factors, many of which are beyond their control. A significant component of our restaurant business costs is related to food commodities, including beef and dairy products, which can be subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, changes in commodity markets, and other factors. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these food commodities, our results of operations may be negatively affected. In addition, our restaurants are dependent upon frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet certain specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, disease or food-5Table of Contentsborne illnesses, inclement weather, or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality, and cost of ingredients, which would likely lower revenues, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.Adverse weather conditions or losses due to casualties could negatively impact our operating performance.Property damage caused by casualties and natural disasters, instances of inclement weather, flooding, hurricanes, fire, and other acts of nature can adversely impact sales in several ways. Many of Steak n Shake’s and Western Sizzlin’s restaurants are located in the Midwest and Southeast portions of the United States. During the first and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Midwest may face harsh winter weather conditions. During the third and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Southeast may experience hurricanes or tropical storms. Our sales and operating results may be negatively affected by these harsh weather conditions, which could make it more difficult for guests to visit our restaurants, necessitate the closure of restaurants, cause physical damage, or lead to a shortage of employees.We are subject to health, employment, environmental, and other government regulations, and failure to comply with existing or future government regulations could expose us to litigation or penalties, damage our reputation, and lower profits.We are subject to various global, federal, state, and local laws and regulations affecting our restaurant operations. Changes in existing laws, rules, and regulations applicable to us, or increased enforcement by governmental authorities, may require us to incur additional costs and expenses necessary for compliance. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, we may be subject to governmental action or litigation, and our reputation could be accordingly harmed. Injury to our reputation would, in turn, likely reduce revenues and profits.The development and construction of restaurants is subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. Difficulties in obtaining, or failure to obtain, the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area.In recent years, there has been increased legislative, regulatory, and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry. As a result, restaurant operations have become subject to regulatory initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food products. The operation of the Steak n Shake and Western Sizzlin franchise system is also subject to franchise laws and regulations enacted by a number of states, and to rules promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Any future legislation regulating franchise relationships may negatively affect our operations, particularly our relationship with franchisees. Failure to comply with new or existing franchise laws and regulations in any jurisdiction, or to obtain required government approvals, could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales. Further national, state, and local government initiatives, such as mandatory health insurance coverage or proposed increases in minimum wage rates, could adversely affect our business.Risks Relating to Our Investment ActivitiesThe majority of our investment activities are conducted through outside investment partnerships, The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P., which are controlled by Mr. Biglari.Our investment activities are conducted mainly through these outside investment partnerships. Under the terms of their partnership agreements, each contribution made by the Company to the investment partnerships is subject to a five-year lock-up period, and any distribution upon our withdrawal of funds will be paid out over a two-year period (and may be paid in-kind rather than in cash, thus increasing the difficulty of liquidating these investments). As a result of these provisions and our consequent inability to access this capital for a defined period, our capital invested in the investment partnerships may be subject to an increased risk of loss of all or a significant portion of value, and we may become unable to meet our capital requirements. There is a high likelihood that we will make additional investments in these investment partnerships in the future.We have a services agreement with Biglari Capital Corp., the general partner of the investment partnerships (“Biglari Capital”), and Biglari Enterprises LLC (collectively, the “Biglari Entities”), in which the Company pays a fixed fee to the Biglari Entities for business and administrative-related services. The Biglari Entities are owned by Mr. Biglari. There can be no assurance that the fees paid will be commensurate with the benefits received.The incentive allocation to which Mr. Biglari, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Capital, is entitled under the terms of the respective partnership agreements is equal to 25% of the net profits allocated to the limited partners in excess of a 6% hurdle rate over the previous high-water mark.Our investments may be concentrated, and fair values are subject to a loss in value.The majority of our investments are held through the investment partnerships, which generally invest in common stocks. These investments may be largely concentrated in the common stocks of a few investees.  A significant decline in the major values of 6Table of Contentsthese investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share and earnings.We are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.We run the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company, which would require us to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive, and potentially adverse regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends, and transactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which we operate our business, nor are registered investment companies permitted to have many of the relationships that we have with our affiliated companies.To avoid becoming and registering as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we operate as an ongoing enterprise, with approximately 2,600 employees, along with an asset base from which to pursue acquisitions. Furthermore, Section 3(c)(3) of the Investment Company Act excludes insurance companies from the definition of “investment company.” Because we monitor the value of our investments and structure transactions accordingly, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions due to those concerns. In addition, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of certain of our operating subsidiaries, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, could result in our inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties, or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company.Risks Relating to Our Insurance BusinessOur success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders.Our results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for risks assumed. A primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses.Our insurance business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance business faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes and other catastrophic events. These events typically increase the frequency and severity of commercial property claims. Because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations, and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in significant volatility in our insurance business’ financial condition and results of operations from period to period. We attempt to manage our exposure to these events through reinsurance programs, although there is no assurance we will be successful in doing so.Our insurance business is subject to extensive existing state, local, and foreign governmental regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues.Our insurance business is subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations may relate to, among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital and reserves that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be placed. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments. Accordingly, existing or new regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance business may adversely impact its results of operations.Risks Relating to Our Brand Licensing BusinessLicensing opportunities for the Maxim brand may be difficult to maintain.Maxim’s success depends to a significant degree upon licensing agreements. These licensing agreements mature from time to time and we may be unable to secure favorable terms for future licensing arrangements. Future licensing partners may also fail to honor their contractual obligations or take other actions that can diminish the value of the Maxim brand. Disputes could arise that prevent or delay our ability to collect licensing revenues under these arrangements. If any of these developments occur or our licensing efforts are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of the Maxim brand, as well as the prospects of our media business, could be materially, adversely affected.7Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our Oil and Gas BusinessOur oil and gas business is exposed to the effects of volatile commodity prices.The single largest variable that affects Southern Oil’s results of operations is the price of crude oil and natural gas. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences Southern Oil’s revenue and profitability. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil or natural gas can have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Our scope of business is concentrated in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico.Any disruption of its extractive business would adversely affect Southern Oil’s revenues and profitability. Southern Oil’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, and other forms of system failures, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.Our oil and gas business can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.Southern Oil’s operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory, and political environments.

There can be no assurance that the fees paid will be commensurate with the benefits received.6Table of ContentsThe incentive allocation to which Mr. Biglari, as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Capital, is entitled under the terms of the respective partnership agreements is equal to 25% of the net profits allocated to the limited partners in excess of a 6% hurdle rate over the previous high-water mark.Our investments may be concentrated and fair values are subject to a loss in value.The majority of our investments are held through the investment partnerships, which generally invest in common stocks. These investments may be largely concentrated in the common stocks of a few investees.  A significant decline in the major values of these investments may produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidated book value per share and earnings.We are subject to the risk of possibly becoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.We run the risk of inadvertently becoming an investment company, which would require us to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive and potentially adverse regulations relating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends and transactions with affiliates. Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which we operate our business, nor are registered investment companies permitted to have many of the relationships that we have with our affiliated companies.To avoid becoming and registering as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we operate as an ongoing enterprise, with approximately 4,000 employees, along with an asset base from which to pursue acquisitions. Furthermore, Section 3(c)(3) of the Investment Company Act excludes insurance companies from the definition of “investment company”. Because we monitor the value of our investments and structure transactions accordingly, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have Investment Company Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions due to those concerns. In addition, adverse developments with respect to our ownership of certain of our operating subsidiaries, including significant appreciation or depreciation in the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, could result in our inadvertently becoming an investment company. If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, that we could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would be unable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertaken during the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company.Risks Relating to Our Insurance BusinessOur success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders.Our results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for risks assumed. A primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that rates are adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses.Our insurance business is vulnerable to significant catastrophic property loss, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance business faces a significant risk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophes and other catastrophic events. These events typically increase the frequency and severity of commercial property claims. Because catastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future results of operations, and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in significant volatility in our insurance business’ financial condition and results of operations from period to period. We attempt to manage our exposure to these events through reinsurance programs, although there is no assurance we will be successful in doing so.Our insurance business is subject to extensive existing state, local and foreign governmental regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues.Our insurance business is subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations may relate to, among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital and reserves that must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be placed. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments. Accordingly, existing or new regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurance business may adversely impact its results of operations.7Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our Media and Licensing BusinessOur media business faces significant competition from other magazine publishers and other forms of media, including digital media, and as a result our media business may not be able to improve its operating results.Our media business competes principally with other magazine publishers. The proliferation of choices available to consumers for information and entertainment has resulted in audience fragmentation and has negatively impacted overall consumer demand for print magazines and intensified competition with other magazine publishers for share of print magazine readership. Our media business also competes with digital publishers and other forms of media. This competition has intensified as a result of the proliferation of mobile devices and the shift in consumer preference from print media to digital media for the delivery and consumption of content.Competition among print magazine and digital publishers for advertising is primarily based on the circulation and readership of magazines and the number of visitors to websites, respectively, and the demographics of customers, advertising rates, plus the effectiveness of advertising sales teams. The proliferation of new platforms available to advertisers, combined with continuing competition from print platforms, has impacted both the amount of advertising our media business is able to sell and the rates it can command.Our pursuit of licensing opportunities for the Maxim brand may prove to be unsuccessful.Maxim’s success depends to a significant degree upon its ability to develop new licensing agreements to expand its brand. However, these licensing efforts may be unsuccessful. We may be unable to secure favorable terms for future licensing arrangements, which could lead to, among other things, disputes with licensing partners that hinder our ability to grow the Maxim brand. Future licensing partners may also fail to honor their contractual obligations or take other actions that can diminish the value of the Maxim brand. Disputes could also arise that prevent or delay our ability to collect licensing revenues under these arrangements. If any of these developments occur or our licensing efforts are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of the Maxim brand, as well as the prospects of our media business, could be materially, adversely affected.Risks Relating to Our Oil and Gas BusinessOur oil and gas business is exposed to the effects of volatile commodity prices.The single largest variable that affects Southern Oil’s results of operations is the price of crude oil and natural gas. The price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences Southern Oil’s revenue and profitability. Extended periods of low prices for crude oil or natural gas can have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Our scope of business is concentrated in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico.Any disruption of its extractive business would adversely affect Southern Oil’s revenues and profitability. Southern Oil’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including physical risks from hurricanes, severe storms, and other forms of system failures, any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.Our oil and gas business can be adversely affected by political or regulatory developments affecting our operations.Southern Oil’s operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments. Litigation or changes in national, state, or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and natural gas, could adversely affect Southern Oil’s operations and profitability"

  Biglari Holdings and its subsidiaries (referredto herein as “we,” “us,” “our,” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risks and uncertaintiesin its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only risks we face.Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair our business operations. Risks relating to Biglari Holdings We are dependent on our Chairmanand CEO.Our success depends on the services ofSardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. All major investment and capital allocation decisions are made for the Companyand its subsidiaries by Mr. Biglari. If for any reason the services of Mr. Biglari were to become unavailable, a material adverseeffect on our business could occur. Sardar Biglari, Chairman and CEO,beneficially owns over 50% of our outstanding shares of common stock, enabling Mr. Biglari to exert control over matters requiringshareholder approval. Mr. Biglari has the ability to controlthe outcome of matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including the election or removal of directors, the amendmentof our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, along with other significant transactions. In addition, Mr. Biglari has the abilityto control the management and affairs of the Company. This control position may conflict with the interests of some or all of theCompany’s passive shareholders, and reduce the possibility of a merger proposal, tender offer or proxy contest for the removalof directors. We are a “controlled company” within themeaning of the New York Stock Exchange rules and thus can rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. Because Mr. Biglari beneficially owns morethan 50% of the Company’s outstanding voting stock, we are considered a “controlled company” pursuant to NewYork Stock Exchange rules. As a result, we are not required to comply with certain director independence and board committee requirements.The Company does not have a governance and nominating committee. Our historical growth rate is notindicative of our future growth.When evaluating our historical growth andprospects for future growth, it is important to consider that while our business philosophy has remained constant our mix of businesshas changed and will continue to change. Our business model makes it difficult to assess our prospects for future growth. 3Table of Contents Biglari Holdings’ access tocapital is subject to restrictions that may adversely affect its ability to satisfy its cash requirements or implement its growthstrategy.We are a holding company and are largelydependent upon dividends and other sources of funds from our subsidiaries in order to meet our needs. Steak n Shake’s creditfacility contains restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to Biglari Holdings. In addition, the ability of our insurance subsidiariesto pay dividends to Biglari Holdings is regulated by state insurance laws, which limit the amount of, and in certain circumstancesmay prohibit the payment of, cash dividends. Furthermore, as a result of our substantial investments in The Lion Fund, L.P. andThe Lion Fund II, L.P., investment partnerships controlled by Mr. Biglari, our access to capital is restricted by the terms oftheir respective partnership agreements, as described more fully below. There is also a high likelihood that we will make additionalinvestments in these investment partnerships. Taken together, these restrictions may result in our having insufficient funds tosatisfy our cash requirements. As a result, we may need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or maynot be available. Competition.Each of our operating businesses facesintense competitive pressure within the markets in which they operate. Competition may arise domestically as well as internationally.Accordingly, future operating results will depend to some degree on whether our operating units are successful in protecting orenhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, our periodic operating resultsmay decline from current levels in the future. We also highlight certain competitive risks in the sections below. Unfavorable domestic and internationaleconomic, societal and political conditions could hurt our operating businesses.To the extent that the economy worsensfor a prolonged period of time, one or more of our significant operations could be materially harmed. In addition, our restaurantoperations depend on having access to borrowed funds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that accessto credit is restricted or the cost of funding increases, our business could be adversely affected. Our operating businesses face avariety of risks associated with doing business in foreign markets.	There is no assurance that our internationaloperations will remain profitable. Our international operations are subject to all of the risks associated with our domestic operations,as well as a number of additional risks, varying substantially country by country. These include, inter alia, internationaleconomic and political conditions, corruption, terrorism, social and ethnic unrest, foreign currency fluctuations, differing culturesand consumer preferences. In addition, we may become subject to foreigngovernmental regulations that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. These include antitrustand tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act, the Foreign Corrupt PracticesAct, and applicable local law. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities andother sanctions, which could harm our business and our financial condition. Potential changes in law or regulationsmay have a negative impact on our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.In prior years, bills have been introducedin Congress that, if enacted, would have prohibited the listing of common stock on a national securities exchange if such commonstock was part of a class of securities that has no voting rights or carries disproportionate voting rights. Although these billshave not been acted upon by Congress, there can be no assurance that such a bill (or a modified version thereof) will not be introducedin Congress in the future. Legislation or other regulatory developments could make the shares of Class A common stock andClass B common stock ineligible for trading on the NYSE or other national securities exchanges. We may not be able to adequatelyprotect our intellectual property, which could decrease the value of our brand and products.The success of our business depends onthe continued ability to use the existing trademarks, service marks, and other components of our brand to increase brand awarenessand further develop branded products. While we take steps to protect our intellectual property, our rights to our trademarks couldbe challenged by third parties or our use of these trademarks may result in a liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution,or unfair competition, adversely affecting our profitability. We may also become subject to these risks in the international marketsin which we operate and in which we plan to expand. Any impairment of our intellectual property or brands, including due to changesin U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, could adverselyimpact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation could have a materialadverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.We are or may be from time to time a partyto various legal actions, investigations and other proceedings brought by employees, consumers, policyholders, suppliers, shareholders,government agencies or other third parties in connection with matters pertaining to our business, including related to our investmentactivities. The outcome of such matters is often difficult to assess or quantify and the cost to defend future proceedings maybe significant. Even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any negative allegationregarding our Company, our business or our products could adversely affect our reputation. While we believe that the ultimate outcomeof routine legal proceedings individually and in the aggregate will not have a material impact on our financial position, we cannotassure that an adverse outcome on, or reputational damage from, any of these matters would not, in fact, materially impact ourbusiness and results of operations for the period when these matters are completed or otherwise resolved. 4Table of Contents Risks Relating to Our Restaurant Operations Our restaurant operations face intensecompetition from a wide range of industry participants.The restaurant business is one of the mostcompetitive industries. As there are virtually no barriers to entry into the restaurant business, competitors may include national,regional and local establishments. There may be established competitors with financial and other resources that are greater thanthe Company’s restaurant operations capabilities. Restaurant businesses compete on the basis of price, menu, food quality,location, and customer service. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national, regional,and local economic conditions. The performance of individual restaurants may be impacted by factors such as traffic patterns, demographictrends, weather conditions, and competing restaurants. Additional factors that may adversely affect the restaurant industry include,but are not limited to, food and wage inflation, safety, and food-borne illness. Changes in economic conditions mayhave an adverse impact on our restaurant operations.Our restaurant operations are subject tonormal economic cycles affecting the economy in general or the restaurant industry in particular. The restaurant industry has beenaffected by economic factors, including the deterioration of global, national, regional and local economic conditions, declinesin employment levels, and shifts in consumer spending patterns. Declines in consumer restaurant spending could be harmful to ourfinancial position and results of operations. As a result, decreased cash flow generated from our business may adversely affectour financial position and our ability to fund our operations. In addition, macroeconomic disruptions could adversely impact theavailability of financing for our franchisees’ expansions and operations. Steak n Shake’s credit facilitymatures on March 19, 2021.The term loan under Steak n Shake’scredit facility matures on March 19, 2021. As of December 31, 2019, $181,498 was outstanding. Biglari Holdings and other affiliates(other than Steak n Shake’s subsidiaries) do not guarantee any of the debt. Steak n Shake may need to seek additional financing,which may not be available on terms commensurate with its current financing arrangement. The inability to refinance the debt wouldnegatively impact our operations and financial condition. Our cash flows and financial positioncould be negatively impacted if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in Steak n Shake’s debt agreements.Covenants in Steak n Shake’s creditfacility include restrictions on, among other things, its ability to incur additional indebtedness and to make distributions tothe Company. Steak n Shake’s ability to make payments on its credit facility and to fund operations depends on its abilityto generate cash, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond ourcontrol. Steak n Shake may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service this debt or to fund its other liquidityneeds. Steak n Shake’s failure to service its debt could constitute an event of default that, if not cured or waived, couldresult, among other things, in the acceleration of their indebtedness, which would negatively impact our operations. However, neitherthe Company nor any of our affiliates (other than Steak n Shake’s subsidiaries) provide any guarantees of Steak n Shake’sindebtedness. Steak n Shake’s re-openingof temporarily closed stores may not be successful in reversing its declining sales or profitability.   Since 2017, Steak n Shake has experienceddeclining sales and profitability.  As of December 31, 2019, a total of 107 Steak n Shake restaurants were temporarily closed. Steakn Shake is actively working to re-open these stores as counter service units. There are no assurances that Steak n Shake willbe able to  restore profitability after re-opening closed stores.  Fluctuations in commodity and energyprices and the availability of commodities, including beef and dairy, could affect our restaurant business.The cost, availability and quality of ingredientsrestaurant operations use to prepare their food is subject to a range of factors, many of which are beyond their control. A significantcomponent of our restaurant business’ costs is related to food commodities, including beef and dairy products, which canbe subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, changes in commoditymarkets, and other factors. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these food commodities, our results of operationsmay be negatively affected. In addition, our restaurants are dependent upon frequent deliveries of perishable food products thatmeet certain specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand,problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather, or other conditions could adverselyaffect the availability, quality, and cost of ingredients, which would likely lower revenues, damage our reputation, or otherwiseharm our business. 5Table of Contents Adverse weather conditions or lossesdue to casualties could negatively impact our operating performance.Property damage caused by casualties andnatural disasters, instances of inclement weather, flooding, hurricanes, fire, and other acts of nature can adversely impact salesin several ways. Many of Steak n Shake’s and Western Sizzlin’s restaurants are located in the Midwest and Southeastportions of the United States. During the first and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Midwest may face harsh winter weather conditions.During the third and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Southeast may experience hurricanes or tropical storms. Our sales andoperating results may be negatively affected by these harsh weather conditions, which could make it more difficult for guests tovisit our restaurants, necessitate the closure of restaurants, cause physical damage, or lead to a shortage of employees. We are subject to health, employment,environmental, and other government regulations, and failure to comply with existing or future government regulations could exposeus to litigation or penalties, damage our reputation, and lower profits.We are subject to various global, federal,state, and local laws and regulations affecting our restaurant operations. Changes in existing laws, rules and regulations applicableto us, or increased enforcement by governmental authorities, may require us to incur additional costs and expenses necessary forcompliance. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, we may be subject to governmental action or litigation, and our reputationcould be accordingly harmed. Injury to our reputation would, in turn, likely reduce revenues and profits. The development and construction of restaurantsis subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. Difficulties in obtaining, or failureto obtain, the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area. In recent years, there has been increasedlegislative, regulatory, and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry. As a result, restaurantoperations have become subject to regulatory initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such as requirementsto provide information about the nutritional content of our food products. The operation of the Steak n Shake and Western Sizzlinfranchise system is also subject to franchise laws and regulations enacted by a number of states, and to rules promulgated by theU.S. Federal Trade Commission. Any future legislation regulating franchise relationships may negatively affect our operations,particularly our relationship with franchisees. Failure to comply with new or existing franchise laws and regulations in any jurisdictionor to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales. Further national,state and local government initiatives, such as mandatory health insurance coverage, or proposed increases in minimum wage ratescould adversely affect our business. Risks Relating to Our Investment Activities Our investment activities are conductedprimarily through outside investment partnerships, The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P., which are controlled by Mr.Biglari.Our investment activities are conductedmainly through these outside investment partnerships. Under the terms of their partnership agreements, each contribution made bythe Company to the investment partnerships is subject to a five-year lock-up period, and any distribution upon our withdrawal offunds will be paid out over a two-year period (and may be paid in-kind rather than in cash, thus increasing the difficulty of liquidatingthese investments). As a result of these provisions and our consequent inability to access this capital for a defined period, ourcapital invested in the investment partnerships may be subject to an increased risk of loss of all or a significant portion ofvalue, and we may become unable to meet our capital requirements. There is a high likelihood that we will make additional investmentsin these investment partnerships in the future. We also have a services agreement withBiglari Capital Corp., the general partner of the investment partnerships (“Biglari Capital”), and Biglari EnterprisesLLC (collectively, the “Biglari Entities”), in which the Company pays a fixed fee to the Biglari Entities for businessand administrative-related services. The Biglari Entities are owned by Mr. Biglari. There can be no assurance that the fees paidwill be commensurate with the benefits received. The incentive allocation to which Mr. Biglari,as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Capital, is entitled under the terms of the respective partnership agreementsis equal to 25% of the net profits allocated to the limited partners in excess of a 6% hurdle rate over the previous high-watermark. Our investments are unusually concentratedand fair values are subject to a loss in value.Our investments are predominantly heldthrough the investment partnerships, which generally invest in common stocks. These investments are largely concentrated in thecommon stock of one investee, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. A significant decline in the major values of these investmentsmay produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidatedbook value per share and earnings. 6Table of Contents We are subject to the risk of possiblybecoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.We run the risk of inadvertently becomingan investment company, which would require us to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “InvestmentCompany Act”).

Because magazines are generally discretionarypurchases for consumers, circulation revenues are sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. Certain economicconditions such as general economic downturns, including periods of increased inflation, unemployment levels, interest rates, gasolineand other energy prices, or declining consumer confidence, may negatively impact consumer spending. Reduced consumer spending ora shift in consumer spending patterns away from discretionary items will likely result in reduced demand for our media business’magazines and may result in decreased revenues. Risks Relating to Our Oil and Gas Business Our oil and gas business is exposedto the effects of volatile commodity prices.The single largest variable that affectsSouthern Oil’s results of operations is the price of crude oil and natural gas.

Our expansion into international markets could also create risks to our brands. In addition, we may become subject toforeign governmental regulations that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and vendors. These includeantitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act, the Foreign CorruptPractices Act, and applicable local law. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilitiesand other sanctions, which could harm our business and our financial condition.4 Table of ContentsPotentialchanges in law or regulations may have a negative impact on our Class A common stock and Class B common stock.In prior years, bills have been introducedin Congress that, if enacted, would have prohibited the listing of common stock on a national securities exchange if such commonstock was part of a class of securities that has no voting rights or carries disproportionate voting rights. Although these billshave not been acted upon by Congress, there can be no assurance that such a bill (or a modified version thereof) will not be introducedin Congress in the future. Legislation or other regulatory developments could make the shares of Class A common stock andClass B common stock ineligible for trading on the NYSE or other national securities exchanges. We may not be able to adequatelyprotect our intellectual property, which could decrease the value of our brand and products.The success of our business depends onthe continued ability to use the existing trademarks, service marks, and other components of our brand to increase brand awarenessand further develop branded products. While we take steps to protect our intellectual property, our rights to our trademarks couldbe challenged by third parties or our use of these trademarks may result in a liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution,or unfair competition, adversely affecting our profitability. We may also become subject to these risks in the international marketsin which we operate and in which we plan to expand. Any impairment of our intellectual property or brands, including due to changesin U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, could adverselyimpact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Litigation could have a materialadverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.We are or may be from time to time a partyto various legal actions, investigations and other proceedings brought by employees, consumers, policyholders, suppliers, shareholders,government agencies or other third parties in connection with matters pertaining to our business, including related to our investmentactivities. The outcome of such matters is often difficult to assess or quantify and the cost to defend future proceedings maybe significant. Even if a claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any negative allegationregarding our Company, our business or our products could adversely affect our reputation. While we believe that the ultimate outcomeof routine legal proceedings individually and in the aggregate will not have a material impact on our financial position, we cannotassure that an adverse outcome on, or reputational damage from, any of these matters would not, in fact, materially impact ourbusiness and results of operations for the period when these matters are completed or otherwise resolved. Certain agreements with our Chairmanand CEO may have an adverse effect on our financial position.We have entered into a license agreementwith Sardar Biglari, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, under which Mr. Biglari has granted the Company an exclusive licenseto use his name when connected to the provision of certain products and services, as well as a sublicense agreement with Steakn Shake that, inter alia, grants Steak n Shake the right to use the trademark “Steak n Shake by Biglari.” Inthe event of a change of control of the Company or Mr. Biglari’s termination without cause or resignation following specifiedoccurrences, including (1) his removal as Chairman of the Board or Chief Executive Officer or (2) his not maintaining sole capitalallocation authority, Mr. Biglari would be entitled to receive revenue-based royalty payments related to the usage of his nameunder the terms of the license agreement for a defined period of no less than five years. In addition, we have an incentive agreementwith Mr. Biglari, in which he is entitled to receive performance-based annual incentive payments contingent on the growth of theCompany’s adjusted book value in each fiscal year. Risks Relating to Our Restaurant Operations Our restaurant operations face intensecompetition from a wide range of industry participants.The restaurant business is one of themost competitive industries. As there are virtually no barriers to entry into the restaurant business, competitors may includenational, regional and local establishments. There may be established competitors with financial and other resources that aregreater than the Company’s restaurant operations capabilities. Restaurant businesses compete on the basis of price, menu,food quality, location, and customer service. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national,regional, and local economic conditions. The performance of individual restaurants may be impacted by factors such as trafficpatterns, demographic trends, weather conditions, and competing restaurants. Additional factors that may adversely affect therestaurant industry include, but are not limited to, food and wage inflation, safety, and food-borne illness.5 Table of ContentsChanges in economic conditionsmay have an adverse impact on our restaurant operations.Our restaurant operations are subject tonormal economic cycles affecting the economy in general or the restaurant industry in particular. The restaurant industry has beenaffected by economic factors, including the deterioration of global, national, regional and local economic conditions, declinesin employment levels, and shifts in consumer spending patterns. The disruptions experienced in the global economy and volatilityin the financial markets have reduced, and may continue to reduce, consumer confidence in the economy, negatively affecting consumerrestaurant spending, which could be harmful to our financial position and results of operations. As a result, decreased cash flowgenerated from our business may adversely affect our financial position and our ability to fund our operations. In addition, macroeconomicdisruptions could adversely impact the availability of financing for our franchisees’ expansions and operations. Our cash flows and financial positioncould be negatively impacted if we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in Steak n Shake’s debt agreements.Covenants in Steak n Shake’s creditfacility include restrictions on, among other things, its ability to incur additional indebtedness and to make distributions tothe Company. Steak n Shake’s ability to make payments on its credit facility and to fund operations depends on its abilityto generate cash, which is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that are beyond ourcontrol. Steak n Shake may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service this debt or to fund its other liquidityneeds. Steak n Shake’s failure to service its debt could constitute an event of default that, if not cured or waived, couldresult, among other things, in the acceleration of their indebtedness, which could negatively impact our operations. However, neitherthe Company nor any of our affiliates provide any guarantees of Steak n Shake’s debts. Fluctuations in commodity and energyprices and the availability of commodities, including beef and dairy, could affect our restaurant business.The cost, availability and quality of ingredientsrestaurant operations use to prepare their food is subject to a range of factors, many of which are beyond their control. A significantcomponent of our restaurant business’ costs is related to food commodities, including beef and dairy products, which canbe subject to significant price fluctuations due to seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, changes in commoditymarkets, and other factors. If there is a substantial increase in prices for these food commodities, our results of operationsmay be negatively affected. In addition, our restaurants are dependent upon frequent deliveries of perishable food products thatmeet certain specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand,problems in production or distribution, disease or food-borne illnesses, inclement weather, or other conditions could adverselyaffect the availability, quality, and cost of ingredients, which would likely lower revenues, damage our reputation, or otherwiseharm our business. Adverse weather conditions or lossesdue to casualties could negatively impact our operating performance.Property damage caused by casualties andnatural disasters, instances of inclement weather, flooding, hurricanes, fire, and other acts of nature can adversely impact salesin several ways. Many of Steak n Shake’s and Western Sizzlin’s restaurants are located in the Midwest and Southeastportions of the United States. During the first and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Midwest may face harsh winter weather conditions.During the third and fourth quarters, restaurants in the Southeast may experience hurricanes or tropical storms. Our sales andoperating results may be negatively affected by these harsh weather conditions, which could make it more difficult for guests tovisit our restaurants, necessitate the closure of restaurants, cause physical damage, or lead to a shortage of employees. We are subject to health, employment,environmental, and other government regulations, and failure to comply with existing or future government regulations could exposeus to litigation or penalties, damage our reputation, and lower profits.We are subject to various global, federal,state, and local laws and regulations affecting our restaurant operations. Changes in existing laws, rules and regulations applicableto us, or increased enforcement by governmental authorities, may require us to incur additional costs and expenses necessary forcompliance. If we fail to comply with any of these laws, we may be subject to governmental action or litigation, and our reputationcould be accordingly harmed. Injury to our reputation would, in turn, likely reduce revenues and profits. The development and construction of restaurantsis subject to compliance with applicable zoning, land use, and environmental regulations. Difficulties in obtaining, or failureto obtain, the required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area.6 Table of ContentsIn recent years, there has been anincreased legislative, regulatory, and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry. As a result,restaurant operations may become subject to regulatory initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising, such asrequirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food products, which could increase expenses. The operationof the Steak n Shake and Western Sizzlin franchise system is also subject to franchise laws and regulations enacted by a numberof states, and to rules promulgated by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Any future legislation regulating franchise relationshipsmay negatively affect our operations, particularly our relationship with franchisees. Failure to comply with new or existing franchiselaws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required government approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspensionon future franchise sales. Further national, state and local government initiatives, such as mandatory health insurance coverage,or proposed increases in minimum wage rates could adversely affect our business. Risks Relating to Our Investment Activities Our investment activities are conductedprimarily through outside investment partnerships, The Lion Fund, L.P. and The Lion Fund II, L.P., which are controlled by Mr.Biglari.Our investment activities are conductedmainly through these outside investment partnerships. Under the terms of their partnership agreements, each contribution made bythe Company to the investment partnerships is subject to a five-year lock-up period, and any distribution upon our withdrawal offunds will be paid out over a two-year period (and may be paid in-kind rather than in cash, thus increasing the difficulty of liquidatingthese investments). As a result of these provisions and our consequent inability to access this capital for a defined period, ourcapital invested in the investment partnerships may be subject to an increased risk of loss of all or a significant portion ofvalue, and we may become unable to meet our capital requirements. There is a high likelihood that we will make additional investmentsin these investment partnerships in the future. We also have a services agreement withBiglari Capital Corp., the general partner of the investment partnerships (“Biglari Capital”), and Biglari EnterprisesLLC (collectively, the “Biglari Entities”), in which the Company will pay a fixed fee to the Biglari Entities for businessand administrative-related services. The Biglari Entities are owned by Mr. Biglari. There can be no assurance that the fees paidwill be commensurate with the benefits received. The incentive allocation to which Mr. Biglari,as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Biglari Capital, is entitled under the terms of the respective partnership agreementsis equal to 25% of the net profits allocated to the limited partners in excess of a 6% hurdle rate over the previous high-watermark. Our investments are unusually concentratedand fair values are subject to a loss in value.Our investments are predominantly heldthrough the investment partnerships, which generally invest in common stocks. These investments are largely concentrated in thecommon stock of one investee, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. A significant decline in the major values of these investmentsmay produce a large decrease in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and can have a material adverse effect on our consolidatedbook value per share and earnings. We are subject to the risk of possiblybecoming an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940.We run the risk of inadvertently becomingan investment company, which would require us to register under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “InvestmentCompany Act”). Registered investment companies are subject to extensive, restrictive and potentially adverse regulationsrelating to, among other things, operating methods, management, capital structure, dividends and transactions with affiliates.Registered investment companies are not permitted to operate their business in the manner in which we operate our business, norare registered investment companies permitted to have many of the relationships that we have with our affiliated companies. To avoid becoming and registering as aninvestment company under the Investment Company Act, we operate as an ongoing enterprise, with approximately 19,000 employees,along with an asset base from which to pursue acquisitions. Furthermore, Section 3(c)(3) of the Investment Company Act excludesinsurance companies from the definition of “investment company”. Because we monitor the value of our investments andstructure transactions accordingly, we may structure transactions in a less advantageous manner than if we did not have InvestmentCompany Act concerns, or we may avoid otherwise economically desirable transactions due to those concerns. In addition, adversedevelopments with respect to our ownership of certain of our operating subsidiaries, including significant appreciation or depreciationin the market value of certain of our publicly traded holdings, could result in our inadvertently becoming an investment company.If it were established that we were an investment company, there would be a risk, among other material adverse consequences, thatwe could become subject to monetary penalties or injunctive relief, or both, in an action brought by the SEC, that we would beunable to enforce contracts with third parties or that third parties could seek to obtain rescission of transactions with us undertakenduring the period it was established that we were an unregistered investment company.7 Table of ContentsRisks Relating to Our InsuranceBusiness Our success depends on our abilityto underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders.Our results of operations depend on ourability to underwrite and set rates accurately for risks assumed. A primary role of the pricing function is to ensure that ratesare adequate to generate sufficient premiums to pay losses, loss adjustment expenses, and underwriting expenses. Our insurance business is vulnerableto significant catastrophic property loss, which could have an adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.Our insurance business faces a significantrisk of loss in the ordinary course of its business for property damage resulting from natural disasters, man-made catastrophesand other catastrophic events. These events typically increase the frequency and severity of commercial property claims. Becausecatastrophic loss events are by their nature unpredictable, historical results of operations may not be indicative of future resultsof operations, and the occurrence of claims from catastrophic events may result in significant volatility in our insurance business’financial condition and results of operations from period to period. We attempt to manage our exposure to these events throughreinsurance programs, although there is no assurance we will be successful in doing so. Our insurance business is subjectto extensive existing state, local and foreign governmental regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generaterevenues.Our insurance business is subject to regulationin the jurisdictions in which it operates. These regulations may relate to, among other things, the types of business that canbe written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capital and reserves that must be maintained, and restrictionson the types and size of investments that can be placed. Regulations may also restrict the timing and amount of dividend payments.Accordingly, existing or new regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictions on our insurancebusiness may adversely impact its results of operations. Risks Relating to Our Media and LicensingBusiness Our media business faces significantcompetition from other magazine publishers and new forms of media, including digital media, and as a result our media businessmay not be able to improve its operating results. Our media business competes principallywith other magazine publishers. The proliferation of choices available to consumers for information and entertainment has resultedin audience fragmentation and has negatively impacted overall consumer demand for print magazines and intensified competition withother magazine publishers for share of print magazine readership. Our media business also competes with digital publishers andother forms of media. This competition has intensified as a result of the growing popularity of mobile devices and the shift inpreference of some consumers from print media to digital media for the delivery and consumption of content. Competition among print magazine and digitalpublishers for advertising is primarily based on the circulation and readership of magazines and the number of visitors to websites,respectively, and the demographics of customers, advertising rates, plus the effectiveness of advertising sales teams. The proliferationof new platforms available to advertisers, combined with continuing competition from print platforms, has impacted both the amountof advertising our media business is able to sell and the rates it can command.8 Table of ContentsOur pursuit of licensing opportunitiesfor the Maxim brand may prove to be unsuccessful.Maxim’s success depends to a significantdegree upon its ability to develop new licensing agreements to expand its brand. However, these licensing efforts may be unsuccessful.We may be unable to secure favorable terms for future licensing arrangements, which could lead to, among other things, disputeswith licensing partners that hinder our ability to grow the Maxim brand. Future licensing partners may also fail to honor theircontractual obligations or take other actions that can diminish the value of the Maxim brand. Disputes could also arise that preventor delay our ability to collect licensing revenues under these arrangements. If any of these developments occur or our licensingefforts are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of the Maxim brand, as well as the prospects of our media business,could be materially, adversely affected. Our media business is exposedto risks associated with weak economic conditions. Because magazines are generally discretionarypurchases for consumers, circulation revenues are sensitive to general economic conditions and economic cycles. Certain economicconditions such as general economic downturns, including periods of increased inflation, unemployment levels, interest rates, gasolineand other energy prices, or declining consumer confidence, may negatively impact consumer spending. Reduced consumer spending ora shift in consumer spending patterns away from discretionary items will likely result in reduced demand for our media business’magazines and may result in decreased revenues.  "
