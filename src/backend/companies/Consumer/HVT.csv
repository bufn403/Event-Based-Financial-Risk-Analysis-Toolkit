17,HVT,HAVERTY FURNITURE,2024-03-07,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate. The following factors, as well as others described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results should be carefully considered. Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks and uncertainties, but they are not the only risks we face. Our reactions to material future developments, as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments, may also impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings.The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including internet-only retailers, regional or independent specialty stores, dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers and national department stores. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, social media campaigns and extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer. Furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial resources and larger customer bases than we have, and as a result may have a more advanced multichannel platform, be able to adapt quicker to changes in consumer behavior, have attractive customer loyalty programs, and maintain higher profitability in an aggressive low-pricing environment. Rapidly evolving technologies are altering the manner in which retailers communicate and transact with customers, led by internet-based and multichannel retailers that have made significant investments in recent years, including with pricing technology and shipping capabilities.5Table of ContentsCompetition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers; increase expenditures; or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If we fail to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales may decline.Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences, tastes and trends cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. We continuously monitor changes in home design trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal marketing research, and regular communication with our retailers and design professionals who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies. However, as with all retailers, our business is susceptible to changes in consumer tastes and trends. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to successfully identify and respond to these changes, our sales may decline.Our future success is largely dependent on our ability to successfully implement our growth and other strategies.Our future success, including our ability to achieve growth and increased profitability, is dependent on the ability of our management team to execute on our long-term business strategy, which includes increasing our retail footprint, expanding our online presence, increasing the efficiency and profitability of our operations, introducing new products in the marketplace and driving increased traffic to our retail stores and e-commerce site through updated marketing efforts. If any of these initiatives are not successful, or require extensive investment, our growth may be limited, and we may be unable to achieve or maintain expected levels of growth and profitability. Furthermore, our ability to expand our retail footprint is dependent on our ability to identify, secure and develop new retail locations, which involves factors outside of our control.Inability to maintain and enhance our brand may materially adversely impact our business.Maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to retain and expand our base of customers and may require us to make substantial investments. Our advertising campaigns utilize digital, television, and social media to maintain and enhance our existing brand equity. We cannot provide assurance that our marketing, advertising, and other efforts to promote and maintain awareness of our brand will be successful and we may incur substantial costs in such efforts. Furthermore, our brand and reputation could be harmed by negative media, including social media, attention, negative online reviews, cybersecurity incidents, product liability or safety concerns or other matters. If our marketing, advertising, and other efforts are unsuccessful or our brand or reputation is damaged, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. This exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions. Changes in exchange rates or tariffs could impact the price we pay for these goods, resulting in potentially higher retail prices and/or lower gross profit on these goods.Based on product costs, approximately 61% of our total furniture purchases (which exclude accessories and mattresses) in 2023 were for goods that were not produced domestically. All our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased, our vendors may increase their prices. Such changes, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:•we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;•if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the cost increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or•we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product or of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.6Table of ContentsWe are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers, or the unavailability of suitable suppliers at reasonable prices or limitations on our ability to source from third-party producers may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality merchandise to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.We source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many of which are located in foreign countries. Although we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, we must compete with other companies for the production capacity of these independent manufacturers. We regularly depend upon the ability of third-party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, develop a skilled workforce, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. Although we monitor production and quality in many third-party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales.We also require third-party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them. As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by our independent manufacturers to adhere to ethical labor or other laws or business practices, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation.Our vendors might fail in meeting our quality control standards or reacting to changes to the legislative or regulatory framework regarding product safety.All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards as well applicable quality standards. Any actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and could result in recalls and other liabilities. Such exposure could harm our brand’s image and negatively affect our business and operating results. Furthermore, concerns around the quality of the products we sell could damage our reputation and result in loss of future revenues.Significant fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits.The primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil-based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic and political climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. While the global supply chain challenges experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic lessened over the past two years, there can be no assurance that further challenges, including shutdowns and shipping delays, will not occur. Such supply chain disruptions could materially adversely impact the ability of our suppliers to fulfil our orders in a timely manner, if at all, and could lead to increased prices, which we may not be able to pass through to our customers.7Table of ContentsOur revenue can be adversely affected by our ability to successfully forecast our supply chain needs and our foreign manufacturers’ ability to comply with international trade rules and regulations.Optimal product flow is dependent on demand planning and forecasting, supplier production according to such planning, and timely transportation. We often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed production dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins resulting from inventory-driven price reductions. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late product arrivals. Increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised could negatively affect sales.In addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by our foreign manufacturers could occur which could lead to investigations by U.S. government agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement actions could delay future imports or otherwise negatively impact our business. There also remains a risk that one or more of our foreign manufacturers will not adhere to applicable legal requirements or our compliance standards such as fair labor standards, the prohibition on child labor and other product safety or manufacturing safety standards. The violation of applicable legal requirements, including labor, manufacturing and safety laws, by any of our manufacturers, the failure of any of our manufacturers to adhere to our global compliance standards or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our manufacturers from those generally accepted in the U.S. could disrupt our supply of products from our manufacturers, could result in potential liability to us or could harm our reputation and brand, any of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.We rely on third party transportation providers for substantially all of our product shipments from our vendors. We rely on third party service providers for substantially all of our product shipments from our vendors, both domestic and foreign, to our DCs and also to handle over-the-road delivery of product from the DCs to our HDCs and some market areas. Our and our vendors’ utilization of these shipping services is subject to risks that are outside of our control, including increases in fuel prices and labor costs, employee strikes, labor shortages, strikes and union organizing activity, delays in shipping (including congestion at domestic and foreign ports), delays in unloading cargo from ships, availability of adequate trucking or railway providers, adverse weather, natural disasters, possible acts of terrorism and outbreaks of disease. All of these risks may impact our ability to receive products from our vendors to necessary points in our distribution system in a cost-effective and timely manner. Any increases in these shipping costs may result in higher costs to us, and we may be unsuccessful in passing along these costs to our customers, negatively impacting our margins and profitability. Furthermore, any delays in receiving products may negatively impact our ability to deliver these products to our customers in a timely manner. Failure to make timely customer deliveries or long lead times for products could cause customers to cancel their orders or not place orders, which, could damage our brand and reputation and negatively impact our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Because of our limited number of distribution centers, our operating results could suffer if one is damaged.We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged or experience significant business interruption. If such an interruption were to occur, our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner would likely be impacted.8Table of ContentsWe rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business. Disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, distribution system and payment information, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to communicate customer information, provide real-time inventory information, and to handle all facets of our distribution system from receipt of goods in the DCs to delivery to our customers’ homes. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, phishing attempts, cyber‑attacks, malware and ransomware attacks, security breaches, severe weather, natural disasters, and errors by employees.The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with integrating various data sources, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems, or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business. Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business information technology systems or failure of our back-up systems could result in longer production times or negatively impact customers resulting in damage to our reputation and a reduction in sales. If our critical information technology systems or back-up systems were damaged or ceased to function properly, we might have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them.Successful cyber-attacks and the failure to maintain adequate cyber-security systems and procedures could materially harm our business.Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers, including ransomware attacks, can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single “hackers” or small groups of “hackers.”We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber-attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods. We are continuously installing new and upgrading existing information technology systems. We use employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to ensure that the Company is protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all companies, including ours. Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider’s security measures in the future and could result in the leak of personal information of customers, employees or business partners. Employee error or other irregularities may also result in a failure of our security measures and a breach of information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. A security breach and loss of information may not be discovered for a significant period of time after it occurs. While we have no knowledge of a material security breach to date, any compromise of data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, the loss of valuable business data, or a disruption of our business. In addition, the costs to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in potential theft, loss, destruction or corruption of information we store electronically, as well as unexpected interruptions, delays or cessation of service, any of which could cause harm to our business operations. 9Table of ContentsMoreover, a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in litigation or fines, fees, or potential liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be unable to attract, train, engage and retain key teammates.Our long-term success and ability to implement our strategic and business planning goals depends on our ability  to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of store and other employees who understand and appreciate our corporate culture and customers. Turnover in the retail industry is generally high. Excessive employee turnover will result in higher employee costs associated with finding, hiring and training new store employees. Furthermore, labor shortages and competition may make it more difficult for us to adequately staff our retail stores and distribution operations and may result in increased labor expenses to us. If we are unable to hire and retain store and other personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, our ability to open new stores and service the needs of our customers may be impaired, the performance of our existing and new stores and operations could be materially adversely affected and our brand image may be negatively impacted. We must also be able to attract, motivate and retain the teammates who staff our distribution centers, customer service centers, and deliver product to our customers, and professionals to implement our technology and other strategic initiatives. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, equity compensation, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs; the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor and employee relations, immigration, federal and state minimum wage requirements, and benefit costs; changing demographics; and our reputation within the labor market. If we areunable to attract and retain a workforce that meets our needs, our operations, service levels, support functions, and competitiveness could suffer and our results could be adversely affected.A failure to recruit, develop and retain effective leaders or the loss or shortage of personnel with key capacities and skills could impact our strategic growth plans and jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets.Our ability to continue to grow our business depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our executive leadership team and other key management personnel. Changes in senior management could expose us to significant changes in strategic direction and initiatives. A failure to maintain appropriate organizational capacity and capability to support our strategic initiatives or to build adequate bench strength with key skillsets required for seamless succession of leadership, could jeopardize our ability to meet our business performance expectations and growth targets. If we are unable to attract, develop, retain and incentivize sufficiently experienced and capable management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer.General RisksAn overall decline in the health of the economy and consumer spending may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which could reduce demand for our products and materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.Our business depends on consumer demand for our products and, consequently, is sensitive to a number of factors that influence general consumer spending on discretionary items in particular. Factors influencing consumer spending include general economic conditions, consumer disposable income, fuel prices, inflation, recession and fears of recession, unemployment, inclement weather, availability of consumer credit, consumer debt levels, conditions in the housing market, interest rates, sales tax rates and rate increases, sustained periods of inflation, civil disturbances and terrorist activities, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, consumer confidence in future economic and political conditions, natural disasters, and consumer perceptions of personal well‑being and security, including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged or pervasive economic downturns could slow the pace of new store openings or cause current stores 10Table of Contentsto temporarily or permanently close. Adverse changes in factors affecting discretionary consumer spending have reduced and may continue to further reduce consumer demand for our products, thus reducing our sales and harming our business and operating results.Historically, because customers consider home furnishings to be postponable purchases, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. The rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability.A significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, governmental efforts to combat climate change through reduction of greenhouse gases may result in higher fuel costs through taxation or other means. Our distribution system, which utilizes three DCs and multiple home delivery centers is very transportation dependent and includes the use of third-party providers to reach the 22 states and the District of Columbia that we serve from our stores across 16 Southern and Midwestern states. Merchandise is delivered to customers' homes by Havertys delivery teams. If transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.ESG risks could adversely affect our reputation and shareholder, employee, customer and third-party relationships and may negatively affect our stock price.Businesses face increasing public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) activities. We risk damage to our brand and reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as environmental stewardship, including with respect to climate change, human capital management, support for our local communities, corporate governance and transparency, or fail to consider ESG factors in our business operations. Additionally, investors and shareholder advocates are placing ever increasing emphasis on how corporations address ESG issues in their business strategy when making investment decisions and when developing their investment theses and proxy recommendations. We may incur meaningful costs with respect to our ESG efforts and if such efforts are negatively perceived, our reputation and stock price may suffer. Pending or unforeseen litigation and the potential for adverse publicity associated with litigation could have a material adverse effect on us. We are involved from time to time in various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business, including commercial, consumer safety, product liability, employment and intellectual property claims. We currently do not expect the outcome of any pending matters to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Litigation, however, is inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that the ultimate outcome of one or more pending claims asserted against us, or claims that may be asserted in the future that we are currently not aware of, or adverse publicity resulting from any such litigation, could adversely impact our business, reputation, sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition"
9,HVT,HAVERTY FURNITURE,2023-03-08,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate. The following factors, as well as others described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results should be carefully considered. Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks and uncertainties, but they are not the only risks we face. Our reactions to material future developments, as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments, may also impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings.The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including internet-only retailers, regional or independent specialty stores, dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers and national department stores. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, social media 5Table of Contentscampaigns and extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer. Furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial resources and larger customer bases than we have, and as a result may have a more advanced multichannel platform, be able to adapt quicker to changes in consumer behavior, have attractive customer loyalty programs, and maintain higher profitability in an aggressive low-pricing environment. Rapidly evolving technologies are altering the manner in which retailers communicate and transact with customers, led by internet-based and multichannel retailers that have made significant investments in recent years, including with pricing technology and shipping capabilities.Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers; increase expenditures; or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If we fail to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales may decline.Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences, tastes and trends cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. We continuously monitor changes in home design trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal marketing research, and regular communication with our retailers and design professionals who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies. However, as with all retailers, our business is susceptible to changes in consumer tastes and trends. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to successfully identify and respond to these changes, our sales may decline.Our future success is largely dependent on our ability to successfully implement our growth and other strategies.Our future success, including our ability to achieve growth and increased profitability, is dependent on the ability of our management team to execute on our long-term business strategy, which includes increasing our retail footprint, expanding our online presence, increasing the efficiency and profitability of our operations, introducing new products in the marketplace and driving increased traffic to our retail stores and e-commerce site through updated marketing efforts. If any of these initiatives are not successful, or require extensive investment, our growth may be limited, and we may be unable to achieve or maintain expected levels of growth and profitability. Furthermore, our ability to expand our retail footprint is dependent on our ability to identify, secure and develop new retail locations, which involves factors outside of our control.We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. This exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions. Changes in exchange rates or tariffs could impact the price we pay for these goods, resulting in potentially higher retail prices and/or lower gross profit on these goods.Based on product costs, approximately 77% of our total furniture purchases (which exclude accessories and mattresses) in 2022 were for goods that were not produced domestically. All our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased, our vendors may increase their prices. Such changes, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:•we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;•if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the cost increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or•we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product or of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.6Table of ContentsWe are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers, or the unavailability of suitable suppliers at reasonable prices or limitations on our ability to source from third-party producers may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality merchandise to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.We source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many of which are located in foreign countries. Although we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, we must compete with other companies for the production capacity of these independent manufacturers. We regularly depend upon the ability of third-party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, develop a skilled workforce, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. Although we monitor production and quality in many third-party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales.We also require third-party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them. As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by our independent manufacturers to adhere to ethical labor or other laws or business practices, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation.Our vendors might fail in meeting our quality control standards or reacting to changes to the legislative or regulatory framework regarding product safety.All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Any actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and could result in recalls and other liabilities. Such exposure could harm our brand’s image and negatively affect our business and operating results.Significant fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits.The primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil-based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic and political climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. While the global supply chain challenges experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic lessened in 2022, there can be no assurance that further challenges, including shutdowns and shipping delays, will not occur. Such supply chain disruptions could materially adversely impact the ability of our suppliers to fulfil our orders in a timely manner, if at all, and could lead to increased prices, which we may not be able to pass through to our customers.Our revenue can be adversely affected by our ability to successfully forecast our supply chain needs and our foreign manufacturers’ ability to comply with international trade rules and regulations.Optimal product flow is dependent on demand planning and forecasting, supplier production according to such planning, and timely transportation. We often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed production dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins resulting from inventory-driven price reductions. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in 7Table of Contentslate product arrivals. Increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised could negatively affect sales.In addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by our foreign manufacturers could occur which could lead to investigations by U.S. government agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement actions could delay future imports or otherwise negatively impact our business. There also remains a risk that one or more of our foreign manufacturers will not adhere to applicable legal requirements or our compliance standards such as fair labor standards, the prohibition on child labor and other product safety or manufacturing safety standards. The violation of applicable legal requirements, including labor, manufacturing and safety laws, by any of our manufacturers, the failure of any of our manufacturers to adhere to our global compliance standards or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our manufacturers from those generally accepted in the U.S. could disrupt our supply of products from our manufacturers, could result in potential liability to us or could harm our reputation and brand, any of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.Because of our limited number of distribution centers, our operating results could suffer if one is damaged.We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged or experience significant business interruption. If such an interruption were to occur, our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner would likely be impacted.We rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business. Disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and operating results.Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, distribution system and payment information, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to communicate customer information, provide real-time inventory information, and to handle all facets of our distribution system from receipt of goods in the DCs to delivery to our customers’ homes. These systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, phishing attempts, cyber‑attacks, malware and ransomware attacks, security breaches, severe weather, natural disasters, and errors by employees.The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with integrating various data sources, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems, or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business. Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business information technology systems or failure of our back-up systems could result in longer production times or negatively impact customers resulting in damage to our reputation and a reduction in sales. If our critical information technology systems or back-up systems were damaged or ceased to function properly, we might have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them.Successful cyber-attacks and the failure to maintain adequate cyber-security systems and procedures could materially harm our business.Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers, including ransomware attacks, can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single “hackers” or small groups of “hackers.”We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber-attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods. We are continuously 8Table of Contentsinstalling new and upgrading existing information technology systems. We use employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to ensure that the Company is protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all companies, including ours. Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider’s security measures in the future and could result in the leak of personal information of customers, employees or business partners. Employee error or other irregularities may also result in a failure of our security measures and a breach of information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. A security breach and loss of information may not be discovered for a significant period of time after it occurs. While we have no knowledge of a material security breach to date, any compromise of data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, the loss of valuable business data, or a disruption of our business. In addition, the costs to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in potential theft, loss, destruction or corruption of information we store electronically, as well as unexpected interruptions, delays or cessation of service, any of which could cause harm to our business operations. Moreover, a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in litigation or fines, fees, or potential liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our business is dependent on certain key personnel; if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.The success of our business depends upon our ability to retain continued service of certain key personnel, and to attract and retain additional qualified key personnel in the future. We face risks related to loss of any key personnel and we also face risks related to any changes that may occur in key senior leadership executive positions. Any disruption in the services of our key personnel could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals and could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. These changes could also increase the volatility of our stock price.Competition for qualified employees and personnel in the retail industry is intense and we may be unable to retain personnel that are important to our business or hire additional qualified personnel. The process of identifying personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our goals is often lengthy. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, marketing and sales personnel, and store managers, and upon the continued contributions of these people. In addition, our operations require the services of qualified and experienced management personnel, with expertise in areas including information technology, merchandising, and supply chain management. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified executives and personnel.Furthermore, a significant portion of our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of store and other employees who understand and appreciate our corporate culture and customers. Turnover in the retail industry is generally high. Excessive employee turnover will result in higher employee costs associated with finding, hiring and training new store employees. If we are unable to hire and retain store and other personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, our ability to open new stores and service the needs of our customers may be impaired, the performance of our existing and new stores and operations could be materially adversely affected and our brand image may be negatively impacted.9Table of ContentsGeneral RisksAn overall decline in the health of the economy and consumer spending may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which could reduce demand for our products and materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.Our business depends on consumer demand for our products and, consequently, is sensitive to a number of factors that influence general consumer spending on discretionary items in particular. Factors influencing consumer spending include general economic conditions, consumer disposable income, fuel prices, inflation, recession and fears of recession, unemployment, inclement weather, availability of consumer credit, consumer debt levels, conditions in the housing market, interest rates, sales tax rates and rate increases, sustained periods of inflation, civil disturbances and terrorist activities, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, consumer confidence in future economic and political conditions, natural disasters, and consumer perceptions of personal well‑being and security, including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged or pervasive economic downturns could slow the pace of new store openings or cause current stores to temporarily or permanently close. Adverse changes in factors affecting discretionary consumer spending have reduced and may continue to further reduce consumer demand for our products, thus reducing our sales and harming our business and operating results.Historically, because customers consider home furnishings to be postponable purchases, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. The rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability.A significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, governmental efforts to combat climate change through reduction of greenhouse gases may result in higher fuel costs through taxation or other means. We deliver substantially all of our customers’ purchases to their homes. Our distribution system, which utilizes three DCs and multiple home delivery centers is very transportation dependent to reach the 22 states we deliver to from our stores across 16 Southern and Midwestern states. If transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its contributory effects on the economy or new health related emergencies could adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. While the level of disruption caused by, and the economic impact of, the COVID-19 pandemic lessened in 2022, there is no assurance that the pandemic will not worsen again, included as a result of the emergence of new strains of the virus, or another health related emergency will not emerge. Any worsening of the pandemic, a new health related emergency and their effects on the economy could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ESG risks could adversely affect our reputation and shareholder, employee, customer and third party relationships and may negatively affect our stock price.Businesses face increasing public scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) activities. We risk damage to our brand and reputation if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as environmental stewardship, including with respect to climate change, human capital management, support for our local communities, corporate governance and transparency, or fail to consider ESG factors in our business operations. Additionally, investors and shareholder advocates are placing ever increasing emphasis on how corporations address ESG issues in their business strategy when making investment decisions and when developing their investment theses and proxy recommendations. We may incur meaningful costs with respect to our ESG efforts and if such efforts are negatively perceived, our reputation and stock price may suffer. 10Table of Contents"
15,HVT,HAVERTY FURNITURE,2022-03-01,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS      The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in        conjunction with Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and        Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.5We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate. The following factors, as well as others described elsewhere in this report or        in our other filings with the SEC, that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results should be carefully considered. Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks and uncertainties, but they        are not the only risks we face. Our reactions to material future developments, as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments, may also impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur,        our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a material effect on our business and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact numerous aspects of our business, and the continuing long-term impact to our business remains unknown. This is due to the numerous uncertainties that have risen from the pandemic, including the          severity and transmissibility of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, the emergence and spread of variants of concern, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the disease, the distribution, efficacy and public          acceptance of vaccines, and economic impact of the foregoing.Despite the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the retail furniture industry has experienced strong consumer demand. The trend of “nesting” spending has generated additional consumer activity in our industry but has also          significantly strained inventory production and supply chains. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in increased inflation throughout the world, which has begun to affect the prices at which manufacturers charge home furniture          retailers, as well as the prices that are charged to customers. To the extent such inflation continues, increases, or both, it may reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Additionally, the COVID-19          pandemic has caused us to require all team members to follow health guidelines including the wearing of masks and practicing social distancing, and for some team members increased the use of remote work and video meetings, all which could          negatively impact our business and harm productivity and collaboration. In addition to the above risks, the continuing pandemic and related economic uncertainty may result in prolonged disruption and volatility to our business, cause additional negative impacts of which we are not currently aware and also magnify          other risks associated with our business and operations, including risks associated with our supply chain and sourcing quality merchandise domestically and outside the U.S.; our ability to promptly adjust inventory levels to meet fluctuations in          customer demand; our ability to open new store locations and expand or remodel existing stores; and our ability to hire and train qualified employees to address temporary or sustained labor disruptions or labor shortages. Accordingly, the          COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products, workforce availability and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings.The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including internet only retailers, regional or independent specialty stores, dedicated franchises        of furniture manufacturers and national department stores. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. Our existing competitors or        new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, social media campaigns and extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we        offer. Furthermore, some of our competitors have greater financial resources and larger customer bases than we have, and as a result may have a more advanced multichannel platform, be able to adapt quicker to changes in consumer behavior, have6attractive customer loyalty programs, and maintain higher profitability in an aggressive low pricing environment. Rapidly evolving technologies are altering the manner in which retailers communicate and transact with customers, led by        internet-based and multichannel retailers that have made significant investments in recent years, including with pricing technology and shipping capabilities.Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If we fail to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales may decline.Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences, tastes and trends cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. We continuously monitor changes in home design trends through attendance at international        industry events and fashion shows, internal marketing research, and regular communication with our retailers and design professionals who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies. However, as with all retailers, our business is susceptible to        changes in consumer tastes and trends. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to successfully identify and respond to these changes, our sales may        decline.We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. This exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions. Changes in exchange rates or tariffs could impact the price we        pay for these goods, resulting in potentially higher retail prices and/or lower gross profit on these goods.Based on product costs, approximately 54% of our total furniture purchases (which exclude accessories and mattresses) in 2021 were for goods not produced domestically. All our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between        the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff        rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such changes, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:•we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;•if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the cost increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or•we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery                  schedules or other key terms.We are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers, or the unavailability of suitable suppliers at reasonable prices or limitations on our ability        to source from third-party producers may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality merchandise to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.We source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many of which are located in foreign countries. Although we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, we must compete with other companies for        the production capacity of these independent manufacturers. We regularly depend upon the ability of third-party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, a skilled workforce, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and        maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. Although we monitor production and quality in many third-party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such        as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively        impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales.7 We also require third-party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them. As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we        may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and        political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation.Our vendors might fail in meeting our quality control standards or reacting to changes to the legislative or regulatory framework regarding product safety.All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Any actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns        could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in recalls and other liabilities. These could harm our brand’s image and negatively affect our business and operating results.Significant fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials and components have resulted in increased costs and caused production delays which, if continued, could result in a decline in sales,        either of which could materially adversely impact our earnings.The primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil-based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those        materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic and political        climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. Furthermore, global supply chains have been negatively impacted by COVID-19 shutdowns and shipping delays. These global supply chain challenges could continue and in turn materially adversely impact the        ability of our suppliers to fulfil our orders in a timely manner, it at all, and may lead to increased prices, which we may not be able to pass through to our customers.Our revenue can be adversely affected by our ability to successfully forecast our supply chain needs and our foreign manufacturers’ ability to comply with international trade rules and regulations.Optimal product flow is dependent on demand planning and forecasting, production to plan by suppliers, and timely transportation. We often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed production dates.        Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess        inventory. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as        promised.In addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by our foreign manufacturers could occur which could lead to investigations by U.S. government agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement        actions could delay future imports or otherwise negatively impact our business. There also remains a risk that one or more of our foreign manufacturers will not adhere to applicable legal requirements or our compliance standards such as fair labor        standards, the prohibition on child labor and other product safety or manufacturing safety standards. The violation of applicable legal requirements, including labor, manufacturing and safety laws, by any of our manufacturers, the failure of any of        our manufacturers to adhere to our global compliance standards or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our manufacturers from those generally accepted in the U.S., could disrupt our supply of products from our manufacturers,        result in potential liability to us and harm our reputation and brand, any of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.8Recent supply chain management disruption has had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Supply chain challenges have been faced by the entire home furnishings industry, including the Company, as a result of COVID-19 related labor shortages and supply chain disruptions. These supply chain disruptions have created significant delays        in our ability to fulfill customer orders and increased backlogs. The receipt of inventory sourced from impacted areas has been slowed or disrupted and our merchandise suppliers are expected to face similar challenges in receiving materials and        fulfilling our orders. In addition, ocean freight capacity issues continue to persist worldwide due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic as there is much greater demand for shipping and reduced capacity and equipment, which has resulted in        recent price increases per shipping container. Streamline ships are charging priority booking fees to allocate space as they have less ships and workers operating. While we continue to manage and evaluate our freight carriers, there is no        indication that shipping container rates will return to historical levels in the near-term and these increases could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.Furthermore, transportation delays, higher oil and gasoline prices, increases on shipping containers rates, more extensive travel restrictions, closures or disruptions of businesses and facilities or social, economic, political or labor        instability in the affected areas, may impact our or our suppliers’ operations and in turn could adversely affect our profitability. We deliver substantially all of our customers’ purchases to their homes. Our distribution system, which utilizes        three DCs and multiple home delivery centers is very transportation dependent to reach the 22 states we deliver to from our stores across 16 Southern and Midwestern states. If transportation costs exceed        amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.Because of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer.We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become        damaged or experience significant business interruption. If such an interruption were to occur, our ability to deliver our products in a timely manner would likely be impacted.We rely extensively on information technology systems to process transactions, summarize results, and manage our business. Disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and        operating results.Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, distribution system and payment information, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We        use management information systems to communicate customer information, provide real-time inventory information, and to handle all facets of our distribution system from receipt of goods in the DCs to delivery to our customers’ homes. These systems        are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, viruses, phishing attempts, cyber‑attacks, malware and ransomware attacks, security breaches, severe weather, natural disasters, and errors by        employees.The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with integrating various data sources, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems, or a breach in security of these systems        could adversely impact the operations of our business. Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business information technology systems or failure of our back-up systems could        result in longer production times or negatively impact customers resulting in damage to our reputation and a reduction in sales. If our critical information technology systems or back-up systems were damaged or ceased to function properly, we might        have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them.9Successful cyber-attacks and the failure to maintain adequate cyber-security systems and procedures could materially harm our business.Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers, including ransomware attacks,        can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single “hackers” or small groups of “hackers.”We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber-attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and        threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods.  We are continuously installing new and upgrading existing information        technology systems. We use employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to ensure that the Company is protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. We are regularly the target        of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and        other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all companies, including ours. Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through        accepted security certification standards.Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider’s security measures in the future and obtain the        personal information of customers, employees or business partners. Employee error or other irregularities may also result in a failure of security measures and a breach of information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may        have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security. A security breach and loss of information may not be discovered for a        significant period of time after it occurs. While we have no knowledge of a material security breach to date, any compromise of data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, the loss of valuable        business data, or a disruption of our business. In addition, the costs to eliminate or alleviate network security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to        address these problems may not be successful, resulting potentially in the theft, loss, destruction or corruption of information we store electronically, as well as unexpected interruptions, delays or cessation of service, any of which could cause        harm to our business operations. Moreover, a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer        relationships and reputation, and result in fines, fees, or potential liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies, as well as risk of litigation, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of        operations and financial condition.Our business is dependent on certain key personnel; if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.The success of our business depends upon our ability to retain continued service of certain key personnel, and to attract and retain additional qualified key personnel in the future. We face risks related to loss of any key personnel and we also        face risks related to any changes that may occur in key senior leadership executive positions. Any disruption in the services of our key personnel could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals and        could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition. These changes could also increase the volatility of our stock price.10Competition for qualified employees and personnel in the retail industry is intense and we may be unable to retain personnel that are important to our business or hire additional qualified personnel. The process of identifying personnel with the        combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our goals is often lengthy. Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified management, marketing and sales personnel, and store        managers, and upon the continued contributions of these people. In addition, our operations require the services of qualified and experienced management personnel, with expertise in the areas including information technology and supply chain        management. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified executives and personnel.Furthermore, a significant portion of our success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of store and other employees who understand and appreciate our corporate culture and customers. Turnover in        the retail industry is generally high. Excessive employee turnover will result in higher employee costs associated with finding, hiring and training new store employees. If we are unable to hire andretain store and other personnel capable of consistently providing a high level of customer service, our ability to open new stores and service the needs of our customers may be impaired, the performance of our existing and new stores and        operations could be materially adversely affected and our brand image may be negatively impacted.Risks Related to Our IndustryAn overall decline in the health of the economy and consumer spending may affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which could reduce demand for our products and materially harm our sales, profitability and        financial condition.Our business depends on consumer demand for our products and, consequently, is sensitive to a number of factors that influence general consumer spending on discretionary items in particular. Factors influencing consumer spending include general        economic conditions, consumer disposable income, fuel prices, inflation, recession and fears of recession, unemployment, inclement weather, availability of consumer credit, consumer debt levels, conditions in the housing market, interest rates,        sales tax rates and rate increases, sustained periods of inflation, civil disturbances and terrorist activities, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, consumer confidence in future economic and political conditions, natural disasters, and        consumer perceptions of personal well‑being and security, including health epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Prolonged or pervasive economic downturns could slow the pace of new store openings or cause current stores to        temporarily or permanently close. Adverse changes in factors affecting discretionary consumer spending have reduced and may continue to further reduce consumer demand for our products, thus reducing our sales and harming our business and operating        results.Historically, because customers consider home furnishings to be postponable purchases, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Should        the current economic recovery falter or the current recovery in housing starts to stall, consumer confidence and demand for home furnishings could deteriorate, which could adversely affect our business through its impact on the performance of our        stores"
7,HVT,HAVERTY FURNITURE,2021-03-09,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate. The following factors, as well as others described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results should be carefully considered. Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks and uncertainties, but they are not the only risks we face. Our reactions to material future developments, as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments, may also impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, a material effect on our business and results of operations.The impacts of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread across the globe have affected businesses in a number of ways. When we extended the pause on our operations at the end of March 2020, there was significant uncertainty as to when we could resume business. As part of our business continuity plan, we made a permanent reduction in our workforce, and raised capital via a sale-leaseback of our distribution facilities. Since we restarted our operations, business has been very strong. The trend of “nesting” spending has generated additional consumer activity in our industry and strained inventory production and supply chains.  Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to require all team members to follow health guidelines including the wearing of masks and practicing social distancing, and for some team members increased the use of remote work and video meetings, all which could negatively impact our business and harm productivity and collaboration.The impact of COVID-19 on our business also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measures taken that affect day-to-day life and the length of time that such measures remain in place to respond to COVID-19, further deterioration of the global economy and the rollout and widespread availability of the vaccine. Consumers, once “freed” from COVID-19 restrictions, may shift their spending to other discretionary purchases. At this point, it is impossible to predict the extent and duration and the degree to which our results of operations will continue to be affected.COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth below.5Risks Related to Our BusinessWe face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings.The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including internet only retailers, regional or independent specialty stores, dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers and national department stores. National mass merchants and electronics and appliance retailers also have limited product offerings. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, and extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer.Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline.Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales may decline.We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. This exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions. Changes in exchange rates or tariffs could impact the price we pay for these goods, resulting in potentially higher retail prices and/or lower gross profit on these goods.Based on product costs, approximately 55% of our total furniture purchases (which exclude accessories and mattresses) in 2020 were for goods not produced domestically. All our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such changes, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:•we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;•if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the cost increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or•we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.We are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers, or the unavailability of suitable suppliers at reasonable prices or limitations on our ability to source from third-party producers may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality merchandise to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.We source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many of which are located in foreign countries. Although we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, we must compete with other companies for the production capacity of these independent manufacturers. We regularly depend upon the ability of third-party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, a skilled workforce, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. Although we monitor production and quality in many third-party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales.6We also require third-party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them. As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation.Our vendors might fail in meeting our quality control standards or reacting to changes to the legislative or regulatory framework regarding product safety.All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards. Any actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in recalls and other liabilities. These could harm our brand's image and negatively affect our business and operating results.Significant fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits.The primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil-based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic and political climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. Significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our vendors’ costs and our profits as discussed above.Our revenue can be adversely affected by risks in our supply chain.Optimal product flow is dependent on demand planning and forecasting, production to plan by suppliers, and timely transportation. We often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed production dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised.We face risks associated with our overseas suppliers including, but not limited to, political or economic instability, geopolitical events, environmental events, widespread health emergencies, such as the novel coronavirus, natural disasters, or social and labor unrest.In addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by our foreign manufacturers could occur which could lead to investigations by U.S. government agencies responsible for international trade compliance. Resulting penalties or enforcement actions could delay future imports or otherwise negatively impact our business. There also remains a risk that one or more of our foreign manufacturers will not adhere to applicable legal requirements or our compliance standards such as fair labor standards, the prohibition on child labor and other product safety or manufacturing safety standards. The violation of applicable legal requirements, including labor, manufacturing and safety laws, by any of our manufacturers, the failure of any of our manufacturers to adhere to our global compliance standards or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our manufacturers from those generally accepted in the U.S., could disrupt our supply of products from our manufacturers, result in potential liability to us and harm our reputation and brand, any of which could negatively affect our business and operating results.7The rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability.A significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability. In addition, governmental efforts to combat climate change through reduction of greenhouse gases may result in higher fuel costs through taxation or other means. We deliver substantially all of our customers’ purchases to their homes. Our distribution system, which utilizes three DCs and multiple home delivery centers is very transportation dependent to reach the 22 states we deliver to from our stores across 16 Southern and Midwestern states.If transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.Because of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer.We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged.Our information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to challenges that could harm our business.Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, distribution system and payment information, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to communicate customer information, provide real-time inventory information, and to handle all facets of our distribution system from receipt of goods in the DCs to delivery to our customers’ homes.The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with integrating various data sources, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems, or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business.Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers, including ransomware attacks, can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single ""hackers"" or small groups of ""hackers.""We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and cyber-attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. We measure our data security effectiveness through industry accepted methods.  We are continuously installing new and upgrading existing information technology systems. We use employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to ensure that the Company is protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all companies, including ours. Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers or employees. Employee error or other irregularities may also result in a failure of security measures and a breach of information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise information security.     A security breach and loss of information may not be discovered for a significant period of time after it occurs. While we have no knowledge of a material security breach to date, any compromise of data security could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, the loss of valuable business data, or a disruption of our business. A security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in fines, fees, or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies.8Risks Related to Our IndustryChanges in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products.A large portion of our sales represents discretionary spending by our customers. Demand for our products is generally affected by a number of economic factors including, but not limited to: interest rates, housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, housing values, the level of mortgage refinancing, consumer confidence, debt levels and retail trends. Declining stock market values, rising food and energy costs, and higher personal taxes adversely affect demand. A decline in economic activity and conditions in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations"
16,HVT,HAVERTY FURNITURE,2020-03-05,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS    The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on Form 10-K or elsewhere.      The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II,      Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this annual report on Form 10-K.We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate. The following factors, as      well as others described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results should be carefully considered. Below, we describe certain important      operational and strategic risks and uncertainties, but they are not the only risks we face. Our reactions to material future developments, as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments, may also impact our business operations or      financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products.A large portion of our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers. Demand for our products is generally affected by a number of economic factors including, but not limited to:      interest rates, housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, housing values, the level of mortgage refinancing, consumer confidence, debt levels and retail trends. Declining stock market values, rising food and energy costs, and higher personal      taxes adversely affect demand. A decline in economic activity and conditions in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.5We face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings.The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including internet only retailers, regional or      independent specialty stores, dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers and national department stores. National mass merchants and electronics and appliance retailers also have limited product offerings. In addition, there are few barriers to      entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us,      including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, and extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer.Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on      our results of operations.If we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline.Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond      in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales may decline.We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. This exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions. In an effort to      discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions and curb what are considered to be unfair trade practices, the United States imposed tariffs on goods manufactured in China. The tariffs      began in September 2018 at 10% of product costs and increased to 25% on March 4, 2019. If the tariffs are increased further or new tariffs on goods produced in other countries were enacted this could adversely affect our results of operations or      profitability.Based on product costs, approximately 59% of our total furniture purchases (which exclude accessories and mattresses) in 2019 were for goods not produced domestically, of which approximately      15% were for goods produced in China. All our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of      the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such changes, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:•we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;•if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the cost increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or•we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our                requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.Significant fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits.The primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil-based products. On a global and      regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates,      price controls, the economic and political climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. Significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our vendors’ costs and our profits as discussed above.6We are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers, many of whom are located in foreign countries, to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers to      meet our requirements, or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices or limitations on our ability to source from certain third-party producers may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a      timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.We source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many of which are located in foreign countries.

The following factors, as well as others described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results should be carefully        considered. Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks and uncertainties, but they are not the only risks we face. Our reactions to material future developments, as well as our competitors’ reactions to those developments,        may also impact our business operations or financial results. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.Changes in economic conditions could adversely          affect demand for our products.A large portion of our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers. Demand for our products is generally affected by a number of        economic factors including, but not limited to: interest rates, housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, housing values, the level of mortgage refinancing, consumer confidence, debt levels and retail trends. Declining stock market values,        rising food and energy costs, and higher personal taxes adversely affect demand. A decline in economic activity and conditions in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.5We face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings.The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of        retailers, including regional or independent specialty stores, dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers and national department stores. National mass merchants and electronics and appliance retailers also have limited product offerings. We        also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any        time. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, and extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable        than we offer.Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any        of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline.Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our success        depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline.We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. This exposes us to certain risks that include        political and economic conditions. Recently, political discourse in the United States has increasingly focused on ways to discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions and curb what        are considered to be unfair trade practices. To address these concerns, tariffs were imposed on goods manufactured in China in an attempt to discourage these practices. The tariffs began in September 2018 at 10% of product costs and were scheduled        to increase to 25% on March 4, 2019. The increase to 25% has been postponed as part of ongoing discussions between the governments of the United States and China. If ultimately enacted, a 25% tariff could negatively impact our ability to source        products from foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our results of operations or profitability.Based on product costs, approximately 70% of our total furniture purchases (which exclude mattresses) in 2018 were for goods not produced        domestically and approximately 35% were produced in China. All our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our        vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such changes, if they occur, could have one or        more of the following impacts:·we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;·if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the cost increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory                  accounting method could be negatively impacted; or·we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower                  quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.Significant fluctuations and volatility in the          cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits.The primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather,        cotton, and certain oil-based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government        regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic and political climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. Significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our vendors’        costs and our profits as discussed above.6We are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers, many of whom are located in foreign countries, to meet our        requirements; any failures by these producers to meet our requirements, or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices or limitations on our ability to source from certain third-party producers may negatively impact our ability to        deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.We source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many of which are located in foreign countries.

As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or        other laws or business practices accepted as ethical, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation.Our vendors might fail in meeting our quality control standards or reacting to changes to the legislative or regulatory        framework regarding product safety.All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we        buy comply with all safety standards.

There also remains a risk that one or more of our foreign        manufacturers will not adhere to applicable legal requirements or our compliance standards such as fair labor standards, the prohibition on child labor and other product safety or manufacturing safety standards. The violation of applicable legal        requirements, including labor, manufacturing and safety laws, by any of our manufacturers, the failure of any of our manufacturers to adhere to our global compliance standards or the divergence of the labor practices followed by any of our        manufacturers from those generally accepted in the U.S., could disrupt our supply of products from our manufacturers, result in potential liability to us and harm our reputation and brand, any of which could negatively affect our business and        operating results.7The rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability.A significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability. We deliver substantially all of our customers’        purchases to their homes. Our distribution system, which utilizes three DCs and multiple home delivery centers is very transportation dependent to reach the 21 states we deliver to from our stores across 16 Southern and Midwestern states.If transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery        charges, then our profitability will suffer.Because of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer.We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing        inventory requirements but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged.Our information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to damage that could harm our business.Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, distribution system and credit        operations, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to communicate customer information, provide real-time inventory information, manage our credit portfolio        and to handle all facets of our distribution system from receipt of goods in the DCs to delivery to our customers’ homes.The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with integrating various data sources, challenges in transitioning to upgraded or        replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems, or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of our business.Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and those threats and the means for obtaining access to information in digital and other storage media are        becoming increasingly sophisticated. Cyber threats and cyber-attackers can be sponsored by countries or sophisticated criminal organizations or be the work of single ""hackers"" or small groups of ""hackers.""We invest in industry standard security technology to protect the Company’s data and business processes against risk of data security breach and        cyber-attack. Our data security management program includes identity, trust, vulnerability and threat management business processes as well as adoption of standard data protection policies. We measure our data security effectiveness through        industry accepted methods.  We are continuously installing new and upgrading existing information technology systems. We use employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to ensure that the Company is protected, to the        greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to        prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact. Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all companies,        including ours. Additionally, we certify our major technology suppliers and any outsourced services through accepted security certification standards.8Nevertheless, as cyber threats evolve, change and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber-attacks        might defeat our or a third-party service provider's security measures in the future and obtain the personal information of customers or employees. Employee error or other irregularities may also result in a failure of security measures and a        breach of information systems. Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent defects of design, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could compromise        information security. A security breach and loss of information may not be discovered for a significant period of time after it occurs. While we have no knowledge of a material security breach to date, any compromise of data security could result        in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws or standards, the loss of valuable business data, or a disruption of our business. A security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or        confidential information could give rise to unwanted media attention, materially damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in fines, fees, or liabilities, which may not be covered by our insurance policies"
1,HVT,HAVERTY FURNITURE,2018-03-02,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Form 10-K.We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate. The following factors, as well as others described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results should be carefully considered.  Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks and uncertainties, but they are not the only risks we face. Our reactions to material future developments, as well as our competitors' reactions to those developments, may also impact our business operations or financial results.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products.A large portion of our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers. Demand for our products is generally affected by a number of economic factors including, but not limited to: interest rates, housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, housing values, the level of mortgage refinancing, consumer confidence, debt levels and retail trends. Declining stock market values, rising food and energy costs, and higher personal taxes adversely affect demand. A decline in economic activity and conditions in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.6We face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings.The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including regional or independent specialty stores, dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers and national department stores. National mass merchants and electronics and appliance retailers also have limited product offerings. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, and extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer.Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline.Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline.We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. This exposes us to certain risks that include political and economic conditions. Recently, political discourse in the United States has increasingly focused on ways to discourage U.S. corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions.  Proposals to address this concern include the possibility of imposing tariffs or other penalties on goods manufactured outside the United States to attempt to discourage these practices.  It has also been suggested that the United States may materially modify or withdraw from some of its existing trade agreements.  Any of these actions, if ultimately enacted, could negatively impact our ability to source products from foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect results of operations or profitability.Based on product costs, approximately 66% of our total furniture purchases (which exclude mattresses) in 2017 were for goods not produced domestically.  All our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such changes, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:·we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;·if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the cost increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or·we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.7Significant fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits.The primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic and political climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. Significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our vendors' costs and our profits as discussed above.We are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers, many of whom are located in foreign countries, to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers to meet our requirements, or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices or limitations on our ability to source from certain third-party producers may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.We source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many of which are located in foreign countries. Although we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, we must compete with other companies for the production capacity of these independent manufacturers. We regularly depend upon the ability of third-party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, a skilled workforce, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. Although we monitor production and quality in many third party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales.We also require third-party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them. As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation.Our vendors might fail in meeting our quality control standards or reacting to changes to the legislative or regulatory framework regarding product safety.All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards.  Any actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in recalls and other liabilities.  These could harm our brand's image and negatively affect our business and operating results.Our revenue could be adversely affected by risks in our supply chain.Optimal product flow is dependent on demand planning and forecasting, production to plan by suppliers, and timely transportation.  We often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed production dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory.Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised.8The rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability.A significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability.  We deliver substantially all of our customers' purchases to their homes.  Our distribution system, which utilizes three DCs and multiple home delivery centers is very transportation dependent to reach the 21 states we deliver to from our stores across 16 Southern and Midwestern states.If transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.Because of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer.We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer.

Changes in exchange rates or tariffs could impact the price we pay for these goods, resulting in potentially higher retail prices and/or lower gross profit on these goods.Based on product costs, approximately 60% of our total furniture purchases in 2015 were for goods not produced domestically.  All of our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices.

As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by us or our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation.Our vendors might fail in meeting our quality control standards or reacting to changes to the legislative or regulatory framework regarding product safety.All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards.  Any actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in recalls and other liabilities.  These could harm our brand's image and negatively affect our business and operating results.Our revenue could be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain.Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised.The rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability.A significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability.  We deliver substantially all of our customers' purchases to their homes.  Our distribution system, which utilizes three DCs and multiple home delivery centers to reach our markets across 16 Southern and Midwestern states, is very transportation dependent.If transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.8Because of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer.We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements, but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged.Our information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to damage that could harm our business.Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, credit operations and distribution system, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems.

These systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:·power loss, computer systems failures and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;·operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;·physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events;·computer viruses;·intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and·tornadoes, fires, floods and other natural disasters.Any failure due to any of these causes, if it is not supported by our disaster recovery plan and redundant systems, could cause an interruption in our operations and result in reduced net sales and profitability.We may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information.We accept electronic payment cards in our stores and over the internet. Amounts tendered through payment card transactions represented approximately 56% of our business in 2015.We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses.

2,HVT,HAVERTY FURNITURE,2015-03-16,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSThe following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this annual report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. ""Financial Statements and Supplementary Data"" of this Form 10-K.We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which will cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate. The following factors, as well as others described elsewhere in this report or in our other filings with the SEC, that could materially affect our business, financial condition or operating results should be carefully considered.  Below, we describe certain important operational and strategic risks and uncertainties, but they are not the only risks we face. Our reactions to material future developments, as well as our competitors' reactions to those developments, may also impact our business operations or financial results.  If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected.Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products.A large portion of our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers. Demand for our products is generally affected by a number of economic factors including, but not limited to: interest rates, housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, housing values, the level of mortgage refinancing, consumer confidence, debt levels and retail trends. Declining stock market values, rising food and energy costs, and higher personal taxes adversely affect demand. A decline in economic activity and conditions in the markets in which we operate would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.6We face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings.The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, electronics and appliance retailers with limited furniture products, and dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers. National mass merchants such as COSTCO also have limited product offerings. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the Internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer.Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline.Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed delivery dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory.We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. Changes in exchange rates or tariffs could impact the price we pay for these goods, resulting in potentially higher retail prices and/or lower gross profit on these goods.The product costs of our furniture purchases for goods not produced domestically was approximately 60% in 2014.  All of our purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such price increases, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:·we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;·if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the cost increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or·we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.Significant fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits.The primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. Significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our vendors' costs and our profits as discussed above.7We are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers, many of whom are located in foreign countries, to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers to meet our requirements, or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales.We source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many of which are located in foreign countries. Although we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, we must compete with other companies for the production capacity of these independent manufacturers. We regularly depend upon the ability of third-party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, a skilled workforce, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. Although we monitor production in third party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales.We also require third-party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them. As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by us or our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation.Our vendors might fail in meeting our quality control standards or reacting to changes to the legislative or regulatory framework regarding product safety.All of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws and regulations, and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards.  Any actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in recalls and other liabilities.  These could harm our brand's image and negatively affect our business and operating results.Our revenue could be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain.Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised.The rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability.A significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability.  We deliver substantially all of our customers' purchases to their homes.  Our distribution system, which utilizes three DCs and multiple home delivery centers to reach our markets across 16 Southern and Midwestern states, is very transportation dependent.If transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.8Because of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer.We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements, but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged.Our information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to damage that could harm our business.Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, credit operations and distribution system, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems.

These disclosure and reporting requirements became effective for calendar year 2013. Affected companies must make disclosures for the first time by May 31, 2014, and annually thereafter. There have been and will continue to be significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Our disclosure will be predicated upon the timely receipt of accurate information from suppliers, who may be unwilling or unable to provide us with the relevant information. As a result, these new requirements could adversely affect our costs, the availability of minerals used in our products and our relationships with customers and suppliers. Our revenue could be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product.

Our distribution system, which utilizes three distribution centers and multiple home delivery centers to reach our markets across 17 Southern and Midwestern states, is very transportation dependent. Additionally, we deliver substantially all of our customers’ purchases to their homes.If transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.Because of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer. We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer.

Amounts tendered through payment card transactions represented approximately 54% of our business in 2012.We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.The terms of our revolving credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may constrain our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions.  8   Our current revolving credit facility contains provisions which limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur certain types of liens, pay cash dividends, redeem capital stock, engage in sale leaseback transactions or real estate sales in excess of $100.0 million. In addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by interests in substantially all of our personal property, primarily our inventories, accounts receivable and cash. In the event of a significant loss in value of our inventory the amount available to borrow will be reduced.  In the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our pledged assets before distributions, if any, were made to our stockholders"

A number of economic factors, including, but not limited to availability of consumer credit, interest rates, consumer confidence and debt levels, retail trends, housing starts, sales of new and existing homes, and the level of mortgage refinancing, generally affect demand for our products. Higher unemployment rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, and higher tax rates adversely affect demand. The decline in economic activity and conditions in the markets in which we operate has, and may continue to, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future.   5  The financial crisis could adversely affect our business and financial performance. The ongoing financial crisis has tightened credit markets and lowered liquidity levels. Lower credit availability may increase borrowing costs. Some of our suppliers are experiencing serious financial problems due to reduced access to credit and lower revenues. Financial duress may prompt some of our suppliers to seek to renegotiate terms with us, reduce production or file for bankruptcy protection. Our customers may be unable to obtain financing to purchase products and meet their payment obligations to us.  The occurrence of these events may adversely affect our operations, earnings, cash flows and/or financial position.We face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings. The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, and dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers. National mass merchants such as COSTCO also have limited product offerings. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the Internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time.  Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer, and expansion by our existing competitors or entry by new competitors into markets where we currently operate.Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline. Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed delivery dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory.We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. Changes in exchange rates or tariffs could impact the price we pay for these goods, resulting in potentially higher retail prices and/or lower gross profit on these goods. During 2011, approximately 53% of our furniture purchases, on a dollar basis were for goods not produced domestically. All of these purchases were denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such price increases, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:·  we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;·  if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the costs increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or·  we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.    6   Significant fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits. The primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. Significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our vendors’ costs and our profits as discussed above.We are dependent upon the ability of our third-party producers, many of whom are located in foreign countries, to meet our requirements; any failures by these producers to meet our requirements, or the unavailability of suitable producers at reasonable prices may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis or result in higher costs or reduced net sales. We source substantially all of our products from non-exclusive, third-party producers, many located in foreign countries. Although we place a high value on long-term relationships with our suppliers, generally we do not have long-term contracts but, instead, conduct business on an order-by-order basis. Therefore, we compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers. We regularly depend upon the ability of third-party producers to secure a sufficient supply of raw materials, adequately finance the production of goods ordered and maintain sufficient manufacturing and shipping capacity. Although we monitor production in third- party manufacturing locations, we cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, such as the reduction of availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines or increases in manufacturing costs. Such difficulties may negatively impact our ability to deliver quality products to our customers on a timely basis, which may, in turn, have a negative impact on our customer relationships and result in lower net sales. We also require third-party producers to meet certain standards in terms of working conditions, environmental protection and other matters before placing business with them. As a result of costs relating to compliance with these standards, we may pay higher prices than some of our competitors for products. In addition, failure by us or our independent manufacturers to adhere to labor or other laws or business practices accepted as ethical, and the potential litigation, negative publicity and political pressure relating to any of these events, could disrupt our operations or harm our reputation. Our revenue could be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised.  7  The rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability. A significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability. Our distribution system, which utilizes three distribution centers and multiple home delivery centers to reach our markets across 17 Southern and Midwestern states, is very transportation dependent. Additionally, we deliver substantially all of our customers’ purchases to their homes.If transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.Because of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer. We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements, but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged.Our information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to damage that could harm our business. Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, credit operations and distribution system, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to communicate customer information, provide real-time inventory information, manage our credit portfolio and to handle all facets of our distribution system from receipt of goods in the DCs to delivery to our customers’ homes. These systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:·  power loss, computer systems failures and internet, telecommunications or data network failures;·  operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;·  physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events;·  computer viruses;·  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and·  tornadoes, fires, floods and other natural disasters.Any failure due to any of these causes, if it is not supported by our disaster recovery plan and redundant systems, could cause an interruption in our operations and result in reduced net sales and profitability.We may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information. We accept electronic payment cards in our stores and over the internet. Amounts tendered through payment card transactions increased from 56% of our sales in 2010 to 58% in 2011 and usage could continue to increase.We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.  8  The terms of our revolving credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may constrain our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. Our current revolving credit facility contains provisions which limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur certain types of liens, pay cash dividends, redeem capital stock, engage in sale leaseback transactions or real estate sales in excess of $100.0 million. In addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by interests in substantially all of our personal property, primarily our inventories, accounts receivable and cash. In the event of a significant loss in value of our inventory the amount available to borrow will be reduced.  In the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our pledged assets before distributions, if any, were made to our stockholders"

These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A), and the consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K Report.We routinely encounter and address risks, some of which will cause our future results to be different – sometimes materially different – than we presently anticipate.

In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time.We may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors. Some of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours and may be able to purchase inventory at lower costs and better sustain economic downturns. Our competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and may have greater resources to devote to promotion and sale of products. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including:·  aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing;·  extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer;·  larger store size, which may result in greater operational efficiencies, wider product assortments or innovative store formats; and·  expansion by our existing competitors or entry by new competitors into markets where we currently operate.  5  Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.If we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline. Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change.

Significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our vendors’ costs and our profits as discussed above.As a result of our reliance on foreign sourcing our ability to service customers could be adversely affected and result in lower sales and earnings. Our overseas vendors may not supply goods that meet our quality specifications or are in conformity with the regulations set forth in the Consumer Product Safety Improvements Act or other federal regulations.  If suppliers do not provide a general conformity certificate then U.S. Customs may turn the goods away at the port. We may reject product that does not meet our specifications.  Accordingly, we may be forced to find alternative sourcing arrangements at a higher cost or to discontinue the product.    6   Our revenue could be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product.

In addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by interests in substantially all of our personal property, primarily our inventories, accounts receivable and cash, excluding store and distribution center equipment and fixtures. In the event of a significant loss in value of our inventory the amount available to borrow will be reduced.  In the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, the lenders under our revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, were made to our stockholders.The terms of our current credit facility ends December 2011.  Our inability to secure replacement financing could adversely affect our operations.We have not had outstanding borrowings under our credit facility since shortly after its origination in December 2008.  A replacement facility is necessary to provide financing for any potential expenditures that exceed cash flows generated from operations.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, we may have to obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing on favorable terms can be obtained.Use of EstimatesOur Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes include estimates and assumptions made by Management that affect reported amounts.

10,HVT,HAVERTY FURNITURE,2009-03-16,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS Set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that, if they were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our business, or that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and the other public statements we  make. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:    projections of revenues, costs, earnings per share, capital expenditures, dividends or other financial measures;     descriptions of anticipated plans or objectives of our management for operations or products;     forecasts of performance; and     assumptions regarding any of the foregoing.   Forward-looking statements involve matters which are not historical facts. Because these statements involve anticipated events or conditions, forward-looking statements often include words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, plan, project, target, can, could, may, should, will, would, or similar expressions. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. They represent our expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made and they might not be updated to reflect changes as they occur after the forward-looking statements are made. For example, forward-looking statements include expectations regarding:    sales or comparable store sales;     gross profit;     SG&A expenses;     capital expenditures; and     developments in accounting standards.   Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect demand for our products.  A large portion of our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers. A number of economic factors, including, but not limited to availability of consumer credit, interest rates, consumer confidence and debt levels, retail trends, housing starts, sales of existing homes, and the level of mortgage refinancing, generally affect demand for our products. Higher unemployment rates, higher fuel and other energy costs, and higher tax rates adversely affect demand. The decline in economic activity and conditions in the markets in which we operate has, and may continue to, adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future. The financial crisis could adversely affect our business and financial performance. The ongoing financial crisis has tightened credit markets and lowered liquidity levels. Lower credit availability may increase borrowing costs. Some of our suppliers are experiencing serious financial problems due to reduced access to credit and lower revenues. Financial duress may prompt some of our suppliers to seek to renegotiate terms with us, reduce production or file for bankruptcy protection. Our customers may be unable to obtain financing to  9  purchase products and meet their payment obligations to us.  The occurrence of these events may adversely affect our operations, earnings, cash flows and/or financial position.  We face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings. The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, and dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers. National mass merchants such as COSTCO also have limited product offerings. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the Internet.

We believe that the introduction and consumer acceptance of our proprietary Havertys brand is a significant part of our ability to maintain or increase revenues. These products are subject to fashion changes and pricing limitations which could affect the success of these and other new products. If we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline. Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline.

Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory. We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. Changes in exchange rates or tariffs could impact the price we pay for these goods, resulting in potentially higher retail prices and/or lower gross profit on these goods. During 2008, approximately 60% of our furniture purchases, on a dollar basis were for goods not produced domestically. All of these purchases were denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such price increases, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts: 10      we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;     if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the costs increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or     we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.   Fluctuations and volatility in the cost of raw materials and components could adversely affect our profits.  The primary materials our vendors use to produce and manufacture our products are various woods and wood products, resin, steel, leather, cotton, and certain oil based products. On a global and regional basis, the sources and prices of those materials and components are susceptible to significant price fluctuations due to supply/demand trends, transportation costs, government regulations and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, price controls, the economic climate, and other unforeseen circumstances. Significant increases in these and other costs in the future could materially affect our vendors costs and our profits as discussed above.  As a result of our reliance on foreign sourcing our ability to service customers could be adversely affected and result in lower sales and earnings. Our overseas vendors may not supply goods that meet our quality or safety specifications in a timely manner.  We may reject goods that do not meet our specifications and find alternative sourcing arrangements at a higher cost or may be forced to discontinue the product. Our revenue could be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised. The rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability. A significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability. Our distribution system, which utilizes three distribution centers and multiple home delivery centers to reach our markets across 17 Southern and Midwestern states, is very transportation dependent. Additionally, we deliver substantially all of our customers purchases to their homes. If transportation costs exceed amounts we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer. Our business depends on our ability to meet our labor needs.  Our success depends on hiring and retaining quality managers and sales associates in our stores. Additionally, our ability to maintain consistency in the quality of customer service in our stores is critical to our success. Also, our sales associates are compensated under a commission structure which historically fosters a high rate of turnover. If we are unable to hire and retain sales associates capable of providing a high level of customer service, our business could be adversely affected.  We are also dependent on the employees who staff our distribution centers, many of whom are skilled. We may be unable to meet our labor needs and control our costs due to external factors such as unemployment levels, minimum wage legislation and wage inflation. Although none of our employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, we cannot guarantee that our employees willnot elect to be represented by labor unions in the future.   11  Because of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer. We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements, but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged. Our information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to damage that could harm our business. Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, credit operations and distribution system, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to communicate customer information, real-time inventory information, manage our credit portfolio and to handle all facets of our distribution system from receiving of goods in the DCs to delivery to our customers homes. These systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:    power loss, computer systems failures and Internet, telecommunications or data network failures.     operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;     physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events;     computer viruses;     intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and     tornadoes, fires, floods and other natural disasters.   Any failure due to any of these causes, if it is not supported by our disaster recovery plan and redundant systems, could cause an interruption in our operations and result in reduced net sales and profitability. We may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information.  We accept electronic payment cards for payment in our stores. During 2008, approximately 45% of our sales were attributable to credit card transactions, and credit card usage could continue to increase.  We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.  Significant differences between actual results and estimates of the amount of future funding for our pension plans and significant changes in funding assumptions or significant increases in funding obligations due to regulatory changes, could adversely affect our financial results.  We have a funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covers most of our employees.  We also have an unfunded non-qualified, non-contributory supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP).  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Code govern the funding obligations for our pension plans.  Our defined benefit plan was frozen as of December 31, 2006 for substantially all participants. For 2007 and beyond, Havertys employees may participate in an enhanced defined contribution plan.  As of December 31, 2008, our projected benefit obligations under our retirement plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately $16.5 million ($11.7 million of which was attributable to the defined pension plan and $4.8 million of which was attributable to the SERP). Estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these plans are based on various assumptions. These assumptions include the discount rates and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. These assumptions are subject to change based on interest rates on high quality bonds, stock and bond market returns.  Significant differences in results or  12  significant changes in assumptions may materially affect our retirement plan obligations and related future contributions and expense.  The terms of our revolving credit facility impose operating and financial restrictions on us, which may constrain our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions. This constraint could have a significant adverse impact on our business.  Our current revolving credit facility contains provisions which restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, issue additional shares of capital stock in certain circumstances, make particular types of investments, incur certain types of liens, pay cash dividends, redeem capital stock, consummate mergers of certain sizes, enter into transactions with affiliates or make substantial asset sales. In addition, our obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured by interests in substantially all of our personal property, primarily our inventories, accounts receivable and cash, excluding store and distribution center equipment and fixtures. In the event of a significant loss in value of our inventory the amount available to borrow will be reduced and may place us in default.  In the event of insolvency, liquidation, dissolution or reorganization, thelenders under our revolving credit facility would be entitled to payment in full from our assets before distributions, if any, were made to our stockholders.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future, we may have to refinance all or a portion of our debt and/or obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that refinancing or additional financing on favorable terms could be obtained.  Use of Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes include estimates and assumptions made by Management that affect reported amounts.

RISK FACTORS Set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that, if they were to occur, could materially and adversely affect our business, or that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report and the other public statements we  make. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to:    projections of revenues, costs, earnings per share, capital expenditures, dividends or other financial measures;     descriptions of anticipated plans or objectives of our management for operations or products;     forecasts of performance; and     assumptions regarding any of the foregoing.   Forward-looking statements involve matters which are not historical facts. Because these statements involve anticipated events or conditions, forward-looking statements often include words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, intend, plan, project, target, can, could, may, should, will, would, or similar expressions. Do not unduly rely on forward-looking statements. They represent our expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made and they might not be updated to reflect changes as they occur after the forward-looking statements are made. For example, forward-looking statements include expectations regarding:    sales or comparable store sales;     gross profit;     SG&A expenses;     capital expenditures; and     developments in accounting standards.   A downturn in the economy may affect consumer purchase of discretionary items, which could reduce our net sales. A large portion of our sales represent discretionary spending by our customers. Many factors affect discretionary spending, including world events, war, conditions in financial markets, general business conditions, interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in the housing markets, consumer debt levels, the availability of consumer credit, taxation, unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending. Our customers purchases of discretionary items, including our products, could decline during periods when disposable income is lower or periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions. If this occurs, our net sales and profitability could decline. We face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings. The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, and dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers. National mass merchants such as Macys, JCPenney and COSTCO also have limited product offerings. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the Internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. 9We may not be able to compete successfully against existing and future competitors. Some of our competitors have financial resources that are substantially greater than ours and may be able to purchase inventory at lower costs and better sustain economic downturns. Our competitors may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and may have greater resources to devote to promotion and sale of products. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including:   aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing;     extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer;     larger store size, which may result in greater operational efficiencies, or innovative store formats;     adoption of improved retail sales methods; and     expansion by our existing competitors or entry by new competitors into markets where we currently operate.   Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. If new products are not introduced or consumers do not accept new products, our sales may decline. Our ability to maintain and increase revenues depends to a large extent on the periodic introduction and availability of new products. We believe that the introduction and consumer acceptance of our proprietary Havertys brand will have a significant impact on our ability to increase revenues. These products are subject to fashion changes and pricing limitations which could affect the success of these and other new products. If we fail to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, our sales may decline. Our products must appeal to our target consumers whose preferences cannot be predicted with certainty and are subject to change. Our success depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends relating to home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, we often make commitments to purchase products from our vendors in advance of proposed delivery dates. Significant deviation from the projected demand for products that we sell may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, either from lost sales or lower margins due to the need to reduce prices to dispose of excess inventory. We import a substantial portion of our merchandise from foreign sources. Changes in exchange rates or tariffs could impact the price we pay for these goods, resulting in potentially higher retail prices and/or lower gross profit on these goods. During 2007, approximately 64% of our furniture purchases, on a dollar basis were for goods not produced domestically. All of these purchases were denominated in U.S. dollars. As exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and certain other currencies become unfavorable, the likelihood of price increases from our vendors increases. Some of the products we purchase are also subject to tariffs. If tariffs are imposed on additional products or the tariff rates are increased our vendors may increase their prices. Such price increases, if they occur, could have one or more of the following impacts:    we could be forced to raise retail prices so high that we are unable to sell the products at current unit volumes;     if we are unable to raise retail prices commensurately with the costs increases, gross profit as recognized under our LIFO inventory accounting method could be negatively impacted; or     we may be forced to find alternative sources of comparable product, which may be more expensive than the current product, of lower quality, or the vendor may be unable to meet our requirements for quality, quantities, delivery schedules or other key terms.   10As a result of our reliance on foreign sourcing our ability to service customers could be adversely affected and result in lower sales and earnings. Our overseas vendors may not supply goods that meet our quality or safety specifications in a timely manner.  We may reject goods that do not meet our specifications and find alternative sourcing arrangements at a higher cost or may be forced to discontinue the product. Our revenue could be adversely affected by a disruption in our supply chain. Disruptions to our supply chain could result in late arrivals of product. This could negatively affect sales due to increased levels of out-of-stock merchandise and loss of confidence by customers in our ability to deliver goods as promised. The rise of oil and gasoline prices could affect our profitability. A significant increase in oil and gasoline prices could adversely affect our profitability. Our distribution system, which utilizes three distribution centers and multiple home delivery centers to reach our markets across 17 Southern and Midwestern states, is very transportation dependent. Additionally, we deliver substantially all of our customers purchases to their homes. If the transportation costs exceed those amounts that we are able to effectively pass on to the consumer, either by higher prices and/or higher delivery charges, then our profitability will suffer.  Our information technology infrastructure is vulnerable to damage that could harm our business. Our ability to operate our business from day to day, in particular our ability to manage our point-of-sale, credit operations and distribution system, largely depends on the efficient operation of our computer hardware and software systems. We use management information systems to communicate customer information, real-time inventory information, manage our credit portfolio and to handle all facets of our distribution system from receiving of goods in the DCs to delivery to our customers homes. These systems and our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from:    power loss, computer systems failures and Internet, telecommunications or data network failures.     operator negligence or improper operation by, or supervision of, employees;     physical and electronic loss of data or security breaches, misappropriation and similar events;     computer viruses;     intentional acts of vandalism and similar events; and     tornadoes, fires, floods and other natural disasters.   Any failure due to any of these causes, if it is not supported by our disaster recovery plan and redundant systems, could cause an interruption in our operations and result in reduced net sales and profitability. Because of our limited number of distribution centers, should one become damaged, our operating results could suffer. We utilize three large distribution centers to flow our merchandise from the vendor to the consumer. This system is very efficient for reducing inventory requirements, but makes us operationally vulnerable should one of these facilities become damaged. Use of Estimates Our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes include estimates and assumptions made by Management that affect reported amounts.
