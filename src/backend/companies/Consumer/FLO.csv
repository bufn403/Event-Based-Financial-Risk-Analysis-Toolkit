18,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2024-02-21,"	Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. These risk factors are not listed in any order of significance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.Operational RisksEconomic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.The willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products may depend in part on economic conditions. Worsening economic conditions or future challenges to economic growth could have a negative impact on consumer demand, which could adversely affect our business. Deterioration of national and global economic conditions could cause consumers to shift purchases to more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, or consumers may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns and could result in decreased demand in the foodservice business. This economic uncertainty may increase pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products.In addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, efforts to combat inflation, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. A disruption or change in the operation of our DSD distribution system could materially and/or negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributor partners could negatively affect our business. Such changes could result from litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate regarding our independent distributorship model, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the independent distributor partners, or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributor partners. These changes could also result from regulatory developments based on the manner in which the U.S. Department of Labor applies the Fair Labor Standards Act. In addition, as a result of California distributor-related litigation, we plan to convert our DSD distribution model in California to an employment model in 2024. Any of these developments could materially and/or negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may not be able to attract or retain the highly skilled people we need for our business.We depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to attract, recruit, hire, develop, and retain qualified individuals, including individuals with e-commerce, digital marketing, and data analytics capabilities. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, recruit, hire, develop, and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss, failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring, and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who terminate their employment or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Labor shortages and increased turnover or increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.We have recently experienced labor shortages at some of our bakeries. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies and benefits offered, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety, wage and hour practices, and immigration. A labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our bakeries and bread lines or otherwise operate at full capacity. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. Additionally, health care, workers’ compensation, postretirement welfare, and pension costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in these costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in benefit plan liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by 13 various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to several factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media platforms by consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Brand recognition and loyalty can be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs and sponsorships, as well as our use of social media. In addition, failure to comply with local or other laws and regulations could also hurt our reputation. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition or were to suffer damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation’s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. In particular, these operating strategies include, among other things, (i) the integration of acquisitions or the acquisition or disposition of assets at presently targeted values, (ii) the deployment of new systems and technology, and (iii) an enhanced organizational structure. Our focus on our long-term goals of being consumer-focused and committed to growing our most profitable brands is dependent on our success in achieving our strategic priorities: (i) develop team; (ii) focus on brands; (iii) prioritize margins; and (iv) smart M&A. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often-complex initiatives. Any delay in, or failure to implement, our strategic initiatives could adversely affect our ability to grow margins. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of our business strategies, our business could be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures. From time to time, we undertake acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and co-investments. The success of any acquisition, divestiture or joint venture depends on the company’s ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits. Acquisitions, including future acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following:•integrating the operations and business cultures of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions;•managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions;•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the prospects of the acquired businesses;•coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations;•attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions;•creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and•expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands and the fair value of such trademarks and brands.Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diverting management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adversely affecting existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Co-investments with third parties through partnership, joint ventures, or other entities, may involve non-controlling, illiquid interests and limited decision-making authority. Investments in partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities may, under certain 14 circumstances, involve risks not present were a third-party not involved, including the possibility that our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, make poor business decisions, or block or delay necessary decisions. Disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our joint venture partners. We have had, and may have in the future, situations where acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, or the expected benefits of such acquisitions or divestitures are not otherwise realized, which has, and may in the future, negatively impacted the company’s business, results of operations or financial condition. Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather, inferior product or ingredient supply, or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers, due to weather, including any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics (such as COVID-19 and any variants), inferior product or ingredient supply, labor strikes or work stoppages, or adverse outcomes in litigation involving our independent distributor model, could impair our ability to make, move or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict or political instability, including any escalation of hostility arising out of the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East, or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events and disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.The third-party vendor management processes may not be appropriately designed to reduce risks related to the delivery of goods, supplies and services. As part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies, we have entered into agreements with third-party vendors for the delivery of goods, supplies and services, including IT services. If we do not select quality vendors, appropriately review vendor contracts and monitor these vendors’ performance (including their ability to protect our customer, consumer or other confidential data), or if any of these third-parties do not perform according to the terms of the agreements, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings, we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such third-party vendors or our reputation could be harmed by any failure to perform.Technology RisksWe may be adversely impacted if our IT systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.The efficient operation of our business depends on our IT systems. We rely on our IT systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our IT systems (including those provided to us by third-parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.In addition, our IT systems (including those provided to us by third parties) may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. Cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently in the United States and are becoming more sophisticated with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyber-attacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including extortion, denial of service, or social engineering through phishing or malware emails. In addition, the risk of cyber-attacks has increased in connection with the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East, and the resulting geopolitical conflicts. In light of those and other geopolitical events, nation-state actors or their supporters may launch retaliatory cyber-attacks, and may attempt to cause supply chain and other third-party service provider disruptions, or take other geopolitically motivated retaliatory actions that may disrupt our business operations, result in data compromise, or both. These circumstances increase the likelihood of cyber-attacks and/or security breaches. In addition, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. There can be no assurance that the policies, protocols, and practices that we follow to address cybersecurity, including our controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information.  We may incur significant costs in protecting or remediating cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees.15 We may experience difficulties in designing and implementing the upgrade of our ERP system. We are in the midst of implementing an upgrade to our ERP system to a more robust platform. The upgrade of the ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance our operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operations of the business. The design and implementation of the upgrade to the ERP system requires an investment of significant personnel and financial resources, including substantial expenditures for outside consultants, system hardware and software in addition to other expenses in connection with the transformation of our financial and operating processes. We may not be able to implement the ERP system upgrade successfully without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties, including potential design defects, miscalculations, testing requirements, and the diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day business operations. If we are unable to implement the ERP system upgrade as planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.Industry RisksIncreases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.Raw materials, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening, yeast, and water, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to foreign and domestic government policies and regulations, inflation, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, availability due to supply chain conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East.  Both conflicts are fast-moving and uncertain. Global grain markets have exhibited increased volatility as sanctions have been imposed on Russia by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and others in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Furthermore, the conflict in the Middle East may impact oil production capacity, oil prices, and cause disruptions in global supply chains and shipping routes. While we do not expect our operations to be directly impacted by these conflicts at this time, changes in global grain and commodity flows and increased supply chain costs could impact the markets in which we operate, which may in turn negatively impact our business, results of operations, supply chain and financial condition. Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices or availability. Our failure to enter into hedging or fixed price arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings. In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. The independent distributors and third-party transportation companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of these fuels may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war or other conflicts (including the current situation in Ukraine and the Middle East), or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing higher-margin products to lower-margin products. Inflation may adversely affect us by increasing our costs of production, materials, and labor. In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the market conditions of the baking industry and the raising of interest rates by the United States Federal Reserve (and the duration of the currently elevated interest rates), we may be unable to raise the prices of our products enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins, and continued inflationary pressures could impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.The U.S. bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. Substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors’ promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods and periods of high inflation. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.16 Product removals, damaged product or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings alleging that the consumption of any of our products causes or caused injury, illness or death. Any such product removal, damaged product or an adverse result in any litigation related to such a product removal or damaged product could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results in future periods, depending on the costs of the product removal from the market, the destruction of product inventory, diversion of management time and attention, contractual and other claims made by customers that we supply, loss of key customers, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if our customers or consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.During fiscal years 2018 through 2023, we have been required, and may be required in future periods, to remove certain of our products from the market should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged, including as a result of inferior ingredients provided by any of our suppliers.Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability.We expect consolidations among our retail and foodservice customers to continue. If this trend continues and our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. In addition, these pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.The fresh packaged bread category has experienced volume declines in recent years reflecting, among other factors, shifts in consumer behavior and preferences. Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, ingredients, and packaging. Similarly, demand for our products could be negatively affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of specific ingredients such as, but not limited to, sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes. Also, certain weight loss drugs and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonists, which may suppress a person's appetite, may impact demand for our products. The introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could cause our sales, profitability, financial condition, and operating results to suffer.We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of sales and the loss of one of our large customers or their decision to give higher priority to other brands could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 55.5% of sales during Fiscal 2023. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, accounted for 22.3% during this period. These customers do not typically enter long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, there is a risk that our customers will give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors, resulting in less shelf space for our products. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 17 Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us, the distributors, and the customers’ other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, reducing shelf space for our products, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by large customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a large customer’s demands, we could lose that customer’s business, which also could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.Legal and Regulatory RisksGovernment regulation, including labeling or warning requirements, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution, and the safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees, are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. In addition, the marketing and labeling of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing and labeling under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Uncertainty regarding labeling standards has led to customer confusion and legal challenges. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional product labeling or warning requirements could reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based in scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In addition, our operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency related to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of waste. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, and affect our sales. Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. Failure to comply with, or violations of, applicable laws and the regulatory requirements of one or more of these entities and agencies could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could result in increased operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results.Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn and wheat. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials, or disrupt our production schedules.We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of climate change, which could impact our production and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.18 Additionally, as concerns about climate change and other environmental issues continue to increase, we may be required to comply with new laws and regulations which may result in increased/not yet identified compliance costs, the scale of which is to be evaluated. We continue to evaluate the possible impact of such new laws and regulations, including those mentioned in the following sentence. In October 2023, California passed new laws that mandate the disclosure of GHG emissions, including Scope 3 emissions, and climate-related financial risks and measures adopted to reduce and adapt to such risks. Both California laws require initial disclosures in 2026.We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.Increasing legal complexity may continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We are or could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, securities laws, employment and personal injury claims, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former distributors, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our independent distributor model and the independent contractor classification of the independent distributors, as well as litigation related to disclosure made by us in connection therewith, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business prospects and the business prospects of our distributors and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide products to customers.Executive OfficesThe address and telephone number of our principal executive offices are 1919 Flowers Circle, Thomasville, Georgia 31757, (229) 226-9110.Information about our Executive Officers The following table sets forth certain information regarding the persons who currently serve as the executive officers of Flowers Foods. 19 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Name, Age and Office Business Experience   A.

3,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2023-02-22,"	Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. These risk factors are not listed in any order of significance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.Operational RisksEconomic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.The willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products may depend in part on economic conditions. Worsening economic conditions or future challenges to economic growth could have a negative impact on consumer demand, which could adversely 12 affect our business. Deterioration of national and global economic conditions could cause consumers to shift purchases to more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, or consumers may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns and could result in decreased demand in the foodservice business. This economic uncertainty may increase pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products.In addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, efforts to combat inflation, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. The extent to which the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and measures taken in response thereto, including any new and emerging variants of the virus and the efficacy and distribution of vaccines, may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.COVID-19 has spread throughout the world, including the U.S., and has resulted in governmental and other regulatory authorities throughout the U.S. implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus and any variants of the virus. These measures have impacted and may further impact the consumer, our workforce and operations, as well as the workforce, operations and financial prospects of our customers, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices and we may take further actions as may be required by governmental and other regulatory authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, vendors and suppliers. We can provide no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to governmental authorities. COVID-19 has had, and will continue to have, a widespread and broad-reaching effect on the economy and our business. Some of the impacts our business has experienced, is experiencing or may experience as a result of COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, the following: •We experienced a favorable shift in sales mix to our branded retail products as compared to pre-pandemic periods due to the change in consumer buying patterns as a result of COVID-19, which positively impacted our business operations, including our sales, operating income and cash flows;•Consumer fears about contracting the disease have altered preferences and spending habits, including significant increases in purchases of fresh and frozen breads during the pendency of quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and other shutdowns; and these trends have moderated in recent periods, which could negatively affect our performance in future periods as compared to prior periods if consumers were to purchase fewer products from us;•We have experienced, and may experience in the future, temporary facility closures or partial shutdowns in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate and in response to positive diagnoses for COVID-19 in certain facilities for the safety of our employees;•Our distribution networks, including our DSD distribution system and our warehouse delivery system, where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers may be disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages;•Disruptions to our suppliers that supply our ingredients, packaging, and other materials necessary to produce, distribute, and sell our products may affect the ability of our suppliers to fulfill their obligations to us and may cause disruptions to our operations; and•We also implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees, which may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business.The extent to which the spread of COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak and additional variants, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the distribution and efficacy of vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of COVID-19’s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Any of these events could exacerbate the other risks and uncertainties described herein, or in other reports filed with the SEC from time to time, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.13 A disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributor partners could negatively affect our business. Such changes could result from litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate regarding our independent distributorship model, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the independent distributor partners, or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributor partners. In addition, these changes could result from regulatory developments based on the manner in which the U.S. Department of Labor applies the Fair Labor Standards Act. Any of these developments could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We may not be able to attract or retain the highly skilled people we need to support our business.We depend on the skills and continued service of key personnel, including our experienced management team. In addition, our ability to achieve our strategic and operating goals depends on our ability to attract, recruit, hire, develop, and retain qualified individuals, including individuals with e-commerce, digital marketing, and data analytics capabilities. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, recruit, hire, develop, and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss, failure or negative perception with respect to these individuals may adversely affect our business or financial results. In addition, activities related to identifying, recruiting, hiring, and integrating qualified individuals may require significant time and expense. We may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who terminate their employment or offer employment to potential replacements on reasonable terms, each of which may adversely affect our business and financial results. Labor shortages and increased turnover or increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.We have recently experienced labor shortages at some of our bakeries. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety, wage and hour practices, and immigration. A labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our bakeries and bread lines or otherwise operate at full capacity. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows. Additionally, health care, workers’ compensation, postretirement welfare, and pension costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in these costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in benefit plan liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to several factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. The growing use of social and digital media platforms by consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Brand recognition and loyalty can be impacted by the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs and sponsorships, as well as our use of social media. In addition, failure to comply with local or other laws and regulations could also hurt our reputation. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition or were to suffer damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.14 We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation’s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. In particular, among other things, (i) the integration of acquisitions or the acquisition or disposition of assets at presently targeted values, (ii) the deployment of new systems and technology, and (iii) an enhanced organizational structure. Our focus on our long-term goals of being consumer-focused and committed to growing our most profitable brands is dependent on our success in achieving our strategic priorities: (i) develop team; (ii) brands focus; (iii) prioritize margins; and (iv) smart M&A activity. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often-complex initiatives. Any delay in, or failure to implement, our strategic initiatives could adversely affect our ability to grow margins. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of our business strategies, our business could be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully realize the expected benefits of acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures. From time to time, we undertake acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and co-investments. The success of any acquisition, divestiture or joint venture depends on the company’s ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits. Acquisitions, including future acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following:•integrating the operations and business cultures of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions;•managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions;•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the prospects of the acquired businesses;•coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations;•attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions;•creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and•expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands and the fair value of such trademarks and brands.Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diverting management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adversely affecting existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. Co-investments with third parties through partnership, joint ventures, or other entities, may involve non-controlling, illiquid interests and limited decision-making authority. Investments in partnerships, joint ventures, or other entities may, under certain circumstances, involve risks not present were a third-party not involved, including the possibility that our joint venture partners might become bankrupt, fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, make poor business decisions, or block or delay necessary decisions. Disputes between us and our joint venture partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses. In addition, we may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our joint venture partners. We have had, and may have in the future, situations where acquisitions, divestitures or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, or the expected benefits of such acquisitions or divestitures are not otherwise realized, which has, and may in the future, negatively impacted the company’s business, results of operations or financial condition. Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather, inferior product or ingredient supply, or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers, due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, inferior product or ingredient supply, labor strikes or work stoppages, or adverse outcomes in litigation involving our independent distributor model, could impair our ability to make, move or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict or political instability, including any escalation of hostility arising out of the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events and disruption to our manufacturing or distribution 15 capabilities, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.The third-party vendor management processes may not be appropriately designed to reduce risks related to the delivery of goods, supplies and services. As part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies, we have entered into agreements with third-party vendors for the delivery of goods, supplies and services, including IT services. If we do not select quality vendors, appropriately review vendor contracts and monitor these vendors’ performance (including their ability to protect our customer, consumer or other confidential data), or if any of these third-parties do not perform according to the terms of the agreements, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings, we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such third-party vendors or our reputation could be harmed by any failure to perform.Technology RisksWe may be adversely impacted if our IT systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.The efficient operation of our business depends on our IT systems. We rely on our IT systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our IT systems (including those provided to us by third-parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.In addition, our IT systems (including those provided to us by third parties) may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. Cyber-attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently in the United States and are becoming more sophisticated with a wide range of expertise and motives. Such cyber-attacks and cyber incidents can take many forms, including extortion, denial of service, or social engineering through phishing or malware emails. In addition, the risk of cyber-attacks has increased in connection with the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the resulting geopolitical conflict. In light of those and other geopolitical events, nation-state actors or their supporters may launch retaliatory cyber-attacks, and may attempt to cause supply chain and other third-party service provider disruptions, or take other geopolitically motivated retaliatory actions that may disrupt our business operations, result in data compromise, or both. These circumstances increase the likelihood of cyber-attacks and/or security breaches. We may incur significant costs in protecting or remediating cyber-attacks or other cyber incidents. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees.We may experience difficulties in designing and implementing the upgrade of our ERP system. We are in the midst of implementing an upgrade to our ERP system to a more robust platform. The upgrade of the ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance our operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operations of the business. The design and implementation of the upgrade to the ERP system requires an investment of significant personnel and financial resources, including substantial expenditures for outside consultants, system hardware and software in addition to other expenses in connection with the transformation of our financial and operating processes. We may not be able to implement the ERP system upgrade successfully without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties, including potential design defects, miscalculations, testing requirements, and the diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day business operations. If we are unable to implement the ERP system upgrade as planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.16 Industry RisksIncreases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.Raw materials, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening, yeast, and water, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to foreign and domestic government policies and regulations, inflation, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, availability due to supply chain conditions, or other unforeseen circumstances. The global economy has been negatively impacted by the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The Russia-Ukraine conflict is fast-moving and uncertain. Global grain markets have exhibited increased volatility as sanctions have been imposed on Russia by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and others in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While we do not expect our operations to be directly impacted by the conflict at this time, changes in global grain and commodity flows could impact the markets in which we operate, which may in turn negatively impact our business, results of operations, supply chain and financial condition. Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices or availability. Our failure to enter into hedging or fixed price arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings. In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. The independent distributors and third-party transportation companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of these fuels may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war or other conflicts (including the current situation in Ukraine), or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing higher-margin products to lower-margin products. Inflation may adversely affect us by increasing our costs of production, materials, and labor. In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the market conditions of the baking industry and the raising of interest rates by the United States Federal Reserve, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins, and continued inflationary pressures could impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.The U.S. bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. Substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors’ promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods and periods of high inflation. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.Product removals, damaged product or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings alleging that the consumption of any of our products causes or caused injury, illness or death. Any such product removal, damaged product or an adverse result in any litigation related to such a product removal or damaged product could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results in future periods, depending on the costs of the product removal from the market, the destruction of product inventory, diversion of management time and attention, contractual and other claims made by customers that we supply, loss of key customers, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if our customers or consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.During fiscal years 2018 through 2022, we have been required, and may be required in future periods, to remove certain of our products from the market should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged, including as a result of inferior ingredients provided by any of our suppliers.17 Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability.We expect consolidations among our retail and foodservice customers to continue. If this trend continues and our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. In addition, these pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, ingredients, and packaging. Similarly, demand for our products could be negatively affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of specific ingredients such as, but not limited to, sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could cause our sales, profitability, and our operating results to suffer.We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of sales and the loss of one of our large customers or their decision to give higher priority to other brands could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 54.5% of sales during Fiscal 2022. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, accounted for 21.7% during this period. These customers do not typically enter long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, there is a risk that our customers will give higher priority to their own products or to the products of our competitors, resulting in less shelf space for our products. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us, the distributors, and the customers’ other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, reducing shelf space for our products, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by large customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a large customer’s demands, we could lose that customer’s business, which also could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.Legal and Regulatory RisksGovernment regulation, including labeling or warning requirements, could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution, and the safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees, are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. In addition, the marketing and labeling of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing and labeling under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Uncertainty regarding labeling standards has led to customer confusions and legal challenges. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional product labeling or warning requirements could reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based in scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. 18 In addition, our operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency related to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, and affect our sales. Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. Failure to comply with, or violations of, applicable laws and the regulatory requirements of one or more of these entities and agencies could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could result in increased operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results.Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn and wheat. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials, or disrupt our production schedules.We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of climate change, which could impact our production and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.Increasing legal complexity may continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We are or could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, securities laws, employment and personal injury claims, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former distributors, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our independent distributor model and the independent contractor classification of the independent distributors, as well as litigation related to disclosure made by us in connection therewith, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business prospects and the business prospects of our distributors and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide products to customers.Executive OfficesThe address and telephone number of our principal executive offices are 1919 Flowers Circle, Thomasville, Georgia 31757, (229) 226-9110.Information about our Executive Officers The following table sets forth certain information regarding the persons who currently serve as the executive officers of Flowers Foods. 19 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Name, Age and Office Business Experience   A.

14,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2022-02-23,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. These risk factors are not listed in any order of significance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.Operational RisksThe extent to which the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and measures taken in response thereto, including any new and emerging variants of the virus and the efficacy and distribution of vaccines, may impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. COVID-19 has spread throughout the world, including the U.S., and has resulted in governmental and other regulatory authorities throughout the U.S. implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus and any variants of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, business limitations, and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact the consumer, our workforce and operations, as well as the workforce, operations and financial prospects of our customers, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures, such as restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our customers, vendors and suppliers. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including temporary bakery closures and restricting production at certain bakeries, restricting employee travel, developing social distancing plans for our employees, and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by governmental and other regulatory authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, vendors and suppliers. We can provide no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to governmental authorities. COVID-19 has had, and will continue to have, a widespread and broad-reaching effect on the economy and our business. Some of the impacts our business has experienced, is experiencing or may experience as a result of COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, the following:  •We experienced a favorable shift in sales mix to our branded retail products due to the change in consumer buying patterns as a result of COVID-19 during Fiscal 2021 and 2020, which positively impacted our business operations, including our sales, operating income and cash flows; •Many of our foodservice customers have periodically closed or restricted operations, which has adversely impacted our revenues from these customers, and has impacted, and could continue to impact, our ability to collect payment from these customers; •Consumer fears about contracting the disease have altered preferences and spending habits, including significant increases in purchases of fresh and frozen breads during the pendency of quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and other 13  shutdowns; and these trends have moderated in recent periods, which could negatively affect our performance in future periods as compared to prior periods if consumers were to purchase fewer products from us; •We have experienced, and may experience in the future, temporary facility closures or partial shutdowns in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate and in response to positive diagnoses for COVID-19 in certain facilities for the safety of our employees; •Our distribution networks, including our DSD distribution system and our warehouse delivery system, where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers may be disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages; •Disruptions to our suppliers that supply our ingredients, packaging, and other materials necessary to produce, distribute, and sell our products may affect the ability of our suppliers to fulfill their obligations to us and may cause disruptions to our operations; and •We also implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees, which may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business.The extent to which the spread of COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak and the emergence of any new or worsening variants, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, including the distribution and efficacy of vaccines, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of COVID-19’s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Any of these events could exacerbate the other risks and uncertainties described herein, or in other reports filed with the SEC from time to time, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.The willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products may depend in part on economic conditions. Worsening economic conditions or future challenges to economic growth could have a negative impact on consumer demand, which could adversely affect our business. Deterioration of national and global economic conditions could cause consumers to shift purchases to more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, or consumers may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns and could result in decreased demand in the foodservice business. This economic uncertainty may increase pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products.In addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, efforts to combat inflation, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. A disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributor partners could negatively affect our business. Such changes could result from litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate regarding our independent distributorship model, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the independent distributor partners, or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributor partners. In addition, these changes could result from regulatory developments based on the manner in which the U.S. Department of Labor applies the Fair Labor Standards Act. Any of these developments could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Labor shortages and increased turnover or increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.We have recently experienced labor shortages at some of our bakeries. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us, including high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations, which include laws and regulations related to workers’ health and safety, wage and hour practices, and immigration. A labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our bakeries and bread lines or otherwise operate at full capacity. An overall labor shortage, lack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation could have a material adverse impact on the company’s operations, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows.  14 Additionally, health care, workers’ compensation, postretirement welfare, and pension costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in these costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in benefit plan liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to several factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. In addition, failure to comply with local or other laws and regulations could also hurt our reputation. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition or were to suffer damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 53.7% of sales during Fiscal 2021. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, accounted for 21.2% of sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation’s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. In particular, we initiated under Project Centennial, among other things, (i) the integration of acquisitions or the acquisition or disposition of assets at presently targeted values, (ii) the deployment of new systems and technology, and (iii) an enhanced organizational structure. Our focus on our long-term goals of being consumer-focused and committed to growing our most profitable brands is dependent on our success in achieving our strategic priorities: (i) develop team; (ii) brands focus; (iii) prioritize margins; and (iv) smart M&A activity. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often-complex initiatives. Any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our ability to grow margins. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of our business strategies, our business could be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations.From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of any acquisition or divestiture depends on the company’s ability to identify opportunities that help the company meet its strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits. Acquisitions, including future acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following: •integrating the operations and business cultures of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions; •managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions; •the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the prospects of the acquired businesses;15   •coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations; •attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions; •creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and •expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands and the fair value of such trademarks and brands.Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diverting management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adversely affecting existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.In situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, or the expected benefits of such acquisitions or divestitures are not otherwise realized, the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted.Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather, inferior product or ingredient supply, or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers, due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, inferior product or ingredient supply, labor strikes or work stoppages, or adverse outcomes in litigation involving our independent distributor model, could impair our ability to make, move or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict or political instability, including any escalation of hostility arising out of the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events and disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.The third-party vendor management processes may not be appropriately designed to reduce risks related to the delivery of goods, supplies and services. As part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies, we have entered into agreements with third-party vendors for the delivery of goods, supplies and services, including IT services. If we do not select quality vendors, appropriately review vendor contracts and monitor these vendors’ performance (including their ability to protect our customer, consumer or other confidential data), or if any of these third-parties do not perform according to the terms of the agreements, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings, we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such third-party vendors or our reputation could be harmed by any failure to perform.Technology RisksWe may be adversely impacted if our IT systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.The efficient operation of our business depends on our IT systems. We rely on our IT systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our IT systems (including those provided to us by third-parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.In addition, our IT systems (including those provided to us by third parties) may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees.We may experience difficulties in designing and implementing the upgrade of our ERP system. We are in the midst of implementing an upgrade to our ERP system to a more robust platform. The upgrade of the ERP system will be designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance our operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operations of the business. The design and implementation of the upgrade to the ERP system 16 requires an investment of significant personnel and financial resources, including substantial expenditures for outside consultants, system hardware and software in addition to other expenses in connection with the transformation of our financial and operating processes. We may not be able to implement the ERP system upgrade successfully without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties, including potential design defects, miscalculations, testing requirements, and the diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day business operations. If we are unable to implement the ERP system upgrade as planned, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.Industry RisksIncreases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.Raw materials, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening, yeast, and water, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to foreign and domestic government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand and supply, armed conflict or political instability, including any escalation of hostility arising out of the conflict between Russia and the Ukraine, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices or availability. Our failure to enter into hedging or fixed price arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings.In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. The independent distributors and third-party transportation companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing higher-margin products to lower-margin products.Inflation may adversely affect us by increasing our costs of production, materials, and labor.  In an inflationary environment, such as the current economic environment, depending on the market conditions of the baking industry and the expected raising of interest rate by the United States Federal Reserve, we may be unable to raise the prices of our products enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins, and continued inflationary pressures could impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.The U.S. bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. Substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors’ promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods and periods of high inflation. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.Product removals, damaged product or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings alleging that the consumption of any of our products causes or caused injury, illness or death. Any such product removal, damaged product or an adverse result in any litigation related to such a product removal or damaged product could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results in future periods, depending on the costs of the product removal from the market, the destruction of product inventory, diversion of management time and attention, contractual and other claims made by customers that we supply, loss of key customers, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if our customers or consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.17 During fiscal years 2018 through 2021, we have been required, and may be required in future periods, to remove certain of our products from the market should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged, including as a result of inferior ingredients provided by any of our suppliers.Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability.We expect consolidations among our retail and foodservice customers to continue. If this trend continues and our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. In addition, these pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, ingredients, and packaging. Similarly, demand for our products could be negatively affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of specific ingredients such as, but not limited to, sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could cause our sales, profitability, and our operating results to suffer.Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us, the distributors, and the customers’ other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, reducing shelf space for our products, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by large customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a large customer’s demands, we could lose that customer’s business, which also could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.Legal and Regulatory RisksGovernment regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution, and the safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees, are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. In addition, the marketing and labeling of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing and labeling under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Uncertainty regarding labeling standards has led to customer confusions and legal challenges.In addition, our operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency related to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, and affect our sales.Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. Failure to comply with, or violations of, applicable laws and the regulatory requirements of one or more of these entities and agencies could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could result in 18 increased operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results.Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn and wheat. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials, or disrupt our production schedules.We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of climate change, which could impact our production and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.Increasing legal complexity may continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We are or could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, securities laws, employment and personal injury claims, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former distributors, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our independent distributor model and the independent contractor classification of the independent distributors, as well as litigation related to disclosure made by us in connection therewith, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business prospects and the business prospects of our distributors and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide products to customers.Executive OfficesThe address and telephone number of our principal executive offices are 1919 Flowers Circle, Thomasville, Georgia 31757, (229) 226-9110.Information about our Executive Officers The following table sets forth certain information regarding the persons who currently serve as the executive officers of Flowers Foods. 19 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Name, Age and Office Business Experience   A.Ryals McMullianAge 52President andChief Executive Officer Mr. McMullian was elected CEO in May 2019.  Previously, he served as COO from July 2018 until May 2019.  Mr. McMullian served as chief strategy officer from May 2017 to July 2018, and as vice president of mergers and acquisitions and deputy general counsel from 2015 until 2017.

4,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2021-02-24,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. These risk factors are not listed in any order of significance. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.Operational RisksThe extent to which the outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict.COVID-19 has spread throughout the world, including the U.S., and has resulted in governmental and other regulatory authorities throughout the U.S. implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and shutdowns. These measures have impacted and may further impact the consumer, our workforce and operations, as well as the workforce, operations and financial prospects of our customers, vendors and suppliers. There is considerable uncertainty regarding such measures and potential future measures, such as restrictions on our access to our manufacturing facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our customers, vendors and suppliers. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including temporary bakery closures and restricting production at certain bakeries, restricting employee travel, developing social distancing plans for our employees, and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by governmental and other regulatory authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, vendors and suppliers. We can provide no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to governmental authorities.COVID-19 has had, and will continue to have, a widespread and broad-reaching effect on the economy and our business. Some of the impacts our business has experienced, is experiencing or may experience as a result of COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, the following: •We have experienced a favorable shift in sales mix to our branded retail products due to the change in consumer buying patterns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has positively impacted our business operations, including our sales, operating income and cash flows, and if there is a shift in mix away from our branded retail products to store branded and non-retail products, we expect that our results of operations, including our net sales, earnings and cash flows, could be negatively impacted; •Many of our foodservice customers have closed or restricted operations, which has adversely impacted our revenues from these customers, and has impacted, and could continue to impact, our ability to collect payment from these customers; •Consumer fears about contracting the disease have altered preferences and spending habits, including significant increases in purchases of fresh and frozen breads during the pendency of quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and other shutdowns; and these trends may not continue or may pull forward demand for our products from future periods, which could negatively affect our performance in future periods if consumers were to purchase fewer products from us; •We have experienced, and may experience in the future, temporary facility closures or partial shutdowns in response to government mandates in certain jurisdictions in which we operate and in response to positive diagnoses for COVID-19 in certain facilities for the safety of our employees; •Our distribution networks, including our DSD distribution system and our warehouse delivery system, where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers may be disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages; •Disruptions to our suppliers that supply our ingredients, packaging, and other materials necessary to produce, distribute, and sell our products may affect the ability of our suppliers to fulfill their obligations to us and may cause disruptions to our operations; and •We also implemented a work from home policy for many of our corporate employees, which may negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business.13 The extent to which the spread of COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus’s global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. Any of these events could exacerbate the other risks and uncertainties described herein, or in other reports filed with the SEC from time to time, and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.Economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.The willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products may depend in part on economic conditions. Worsening economic conditions or future challenges to economic growth could have a negative impact on consumer demand, which could adversely affect our business. Deterioration of national and global economic conditions could cause consumers to shift purchases to more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, or consumers may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns and could result in decreased demand in the foodservice business. This economic uncertainty may increase pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products.In addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. In this regard, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced on July 27, 2017 that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calibration of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced plans to cease publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two-month tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other tenors. Certain of our variable rate debt and credit facility (as defined below) and hedging relationships use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. While we expect to have replaced or renegotiated these agreements by the end of 2021, we plan to incur additional indebtedness and/or negotiate new terms that will rely on alternative rates. The future of LIBOR is uncertain. Any legal or regulatory changes made in response to LIBOR’s future discontinuance may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in or cessation of the publication of LIBOR, or changes in the rules or methodologies underpinning LIBOR. In addition, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and any such rates may be impossible or impracticable to determine. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the recommend alternative to LIBOR. The selection of SOFR as the alternative reference rate, however, currently presents certain market concerns and its acceptance as a LIBOR alternative is uncertain. We are evaluating the potential impact of the transition from LIBOR. While we do not expect that the transition from LIBOR and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, the size and scope of its impact on our financing costs is still uncertain at this time. If any of these events occurs, or if economic conditions become unfavorable, our financing costs, sales and profitability could be adversely affected.A disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate regarding our independent distributorship model, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the independent distributors, or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributors, could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to several factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. In addition, failure to comply with local or other laws and regulations could also hurt our reputation. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition or were to suffer damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.14 We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 53.6% of sales during Fiscal 2020. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, accounted for 21.2% of sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation’s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. In particular, we initiated under Project Centennial, among other things, (i) the integration of acquisitions or the acquisition or disposition of assets at presently targeted values, (ii) the deployment of new systems and technology, and (iii) an enhanced organizational structure. Our focus on our long-term goals dedicated to the consumer and committed to growing our most profitable brands is dependent on our success in achieving our strategic priorities: (i) develop team; (ii) brands focus; (iii) prioritize margins; and (iv) smart M&A activity. These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often-complex initiatives. Any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our ability to grow margins. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of our business strategies, our business could be adversely affected.We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations.From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of any acquisition or divestiture depends on the company’s ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits. Acquisitions, including future acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following: •integrating the operations and business cultures of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions; •managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions; •the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the prospects of the acquired businesses; •coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations; •attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions; •creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and •expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands and the fair value of such trademarks and brands.Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diverting management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adversely affecting existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.In situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, or the expected benefits of such acquisitions or divestitures are not otherwise realized, the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted.15 Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather, inferior product or ingredient supply, or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers, due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, inferior product or ingredient supply, labor strikes or work stoppages, or adverse outcomes in litigation involving our independent distributor model, could impair our ability to make, move or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events and disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.The third-party vendor management processes may not be appropriately designed to reduce risks related to the delivery of goods, supplies and services. As part of a concerted effort to achieve cost savings and efficiencies, we have entered into agreements with third-party vendors for the delivery of goods, supplies and services, including IT services. If we do not select quality vendors, appropriately review vendor contracts and monitor these vendors’ performance (including their ability to protect our customer, consumer or other confidential data), or if any of these third-parties do not perform according to the terms of the agreements, we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings, we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such third-party vendors or our reputation could be harmed by any failure to perform.Increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.Health care and workers’ compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in these costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in benefit plan liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors.  In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results. Technology RisksWe may be adversely impacted if our IT systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.The efficient operation of our business depends on our IT systems. We rely on our IT systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our IT systems (including those provided to us by third-parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.In addition, our IT systems (including those provided to us by third parties) may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees.We may experience difficulties in designing and implementing our new ERP system.We are in the midst of implementing a new ERP system, which will replace our existing financial and operating systems. The ERP system will be designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance our operational functionality and provide timely information to our management team related to the operations of the business. The design and implementation of this new ERP system requires an investment of significant personnel and financial resources, including substantial expenditures for outside consultants, system hardware and software in addition to other expenses in connection with the transformation of our organizational structure and financial and operating processes. We may not be able to implement the ERP system successfully without experiencing delays, increased costs and other difficulties, including potential design defects, miscalculations, testing requirements, and the diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day business operations. If we are unable to implement the new ERP system as planned, the 16 effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could be adversely affected, our ability to assess those controls adequately could be delayed, and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted.Industry RisksIncreases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.Raw materials, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening, yeast, and water, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to foreign and domestic government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices or availability. Our failure to enter into hedging or fixed price arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings.In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. The independent distributors and third-party transportation companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing higher-margin products to lower-margin products.Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.The U.S. bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. Substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors’ promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.Product removals, damaged product or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings alleging that the consumption of any of our products causes or caused injury, illness or death. Any such product removal, damaged product or an adverse result in any litigation related to such a product removal or damaged product could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results in future periods, depending on the costs of the product removal from the market, the destruction of product inventory, diversion of management time and attention, contractual and other claims made by customers that we supply, loss of key customers, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if our customers or consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.During Fiscal 2018, 2019, and 2020, we have been required, and may be required in future periods, to remove certain of our products from the market should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged, including as a result of inferior ingredients provided by any of our suppliers.Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability.We expect consolidations among our retail and foodservice customers to continue. If this trend continues and our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. In addition, these pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.17 Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, ingredients, and packaging. Similarly, demand for our products could be negatively affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of specific ingredients such as, but not limited to, sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could cause our sales, profitability, and our operating results to suffer.Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us, the distributors, and the customers’ other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, reducing shelf space for our products, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by large customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a large customer’s demands, we could lose that customer’s business, which also could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.Legal and Regulatory RisksGovernment regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution, and the safety of food products and the health and safety of our employees, are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. In addition, the marketing and labeling of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing and labeling under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Uncertainty regarding labeling standards has led to customer confusions and legal challenges.In addition, our operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency related to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, and affect our sales.Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. Failure to comply with, or violations of, applicable laws and the regulatory requirements of one or more of these entities and agencies could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could result in increased operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results.Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn and wheat. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials, or disrupt our production schedules.18 We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our production and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.Increasing legal complexity may continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We are or could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, securities laws, employment and personal injury claims, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former distributors, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our independent distributor model and the independent contractor classification of the independent distributors, as well as litigation related to disclosure made by us in connection therewith, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business prospects and the business prospects of our distributors and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide products to customers.Executive OfficesThe address and telephone number of our principal executive offices are 1919 Flowers Circle, Thomasville, Georgia 31757, (229) 226-9110.Information about our Executive Officers The following table sets forth certain information regarding the persons who currently serve as the executive officers of Flowers Foods.

11,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2020-02-19,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. These risk factors are not listed in any order of significance.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.Economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.The willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products may depend in part on economic conditions. Worsening economic conditions or future challenges to economic growth could have a negative impact on consumer demand, which could adversely affect our business. Deterioration of national and global economic conditions could cause consumers to shift purchases to more generic, lower-priced, or other value offerings, or consumers may forego certain purchases altogether during economic downturns and could result in decreased demand in the foodservice business. This economic uncertainty may increase pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. In this regard, the administering regulatory authority announced it intends to phase out London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) by the end of 2021. Certain of our variable rate debt and revolving credit facility use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing interest rates. While we expect to have replaced or renegotiated our revolving credit facility by the end of 2021, we plan to incur additional indebtedness and/or negotiate new terms that will rely on an alternative method to LIBOR. Any legal or regulatory changes made in response to LIBOR’s future discontinuance may result in, among other things, a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in LIBOR, a delay in the publication of LIBOR, or changes in the rules or methodologies in LIBOR. In addition, alternative methods to LIBOR may be impossible or impracticable to determine. While we do not expect that the transition from LIBOR and risks related thereto will have a material adverse effect on our financing costs, it is still uncertain at this time. If any of these events occurs, or if economic conditions become unfavorable, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.Raw materials, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening, yeast, and water, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to foreign and domestic government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices or availability. Our failure to enter into hedging or fixed price arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings.11 In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. The independent distributors and third-party transportation companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-margin products to lower-margin products.  Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.The U.S. bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. Substantial growth in e-commerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models, intensifying competition by simplifying distribution and lowering barriers to entry. The expanding presence of e-commerce retailers has impacted, and may continue to impact, consumer preferences and market dynamics, which in turn may negatively affect our sales or profits.  We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors’ promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.A disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independent distributorship model, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the independent distributors, or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributors, could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to several factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. In addition, failure to comply with local or other laws and regulations could also hurt our reputation. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition or were to suffer damage to our reputation or loss of consumer confidence in our products for any of these reasons, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 51.0% of sales during fiscal 2019. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, accounted for 21.1% of sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.12 Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation’s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution.  In particular, we have initiated under Project Centennial, among other things, (i) the integration of acquisitions or the acquisition or disposition of assets at presently targeted values, (ii) the deployment of new systems and technology, and (iii) an enhanced organizational structure.  These and related demands on our resources may divert the organization’s attention from other business issues. Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing, and realizing cost savings or other benefits from, these often-complex initiatives. Any failure to implement our initiatives could adversely affect our ability to grow margins. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing Project Centennial or one or more of our business strategies, our business could be adversely affected.Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, ingredients, and packaging. Similarly, demand for our products could be negatively affected by consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the health effects of specific ingredients such as, but not limited to, sodium, trans fats, sugar, processed wheat, or other product ingredients or attributes. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could cause our sales, profitability, and our operating results to suffer.We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations.From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of any acquisition or divestiture depends on the company’s ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits.Acquisitions, including future acquisitions and the Canyon acquisition completed in fiscal 2018, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following: •integrating the operations and business cultures of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions; •managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions; •the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the prospects of the acquired businesses; •coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations; •attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions; •creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and •expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands and the fair value of such trademarks and brands.Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diverting management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adversely affecting existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.In situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, or the expected benefits of such acquisitions or divestitures are not otherwise realized, the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted.13 We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.Increasing legal complexity may continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We are or could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, securities laws, employment and personal injury claims, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former distributors, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our independent distributor model and the independent contractor classification of the independent distributors, as well as litigation related to disclosure made by us in connection therewith, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business prospects and the business prospects of our distributors and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide products to customers.Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather, inferior product or ingredient supply, or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers, due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, inferior product or ingredient supply, labor strikes or work stoppages, or adverse outcomes in litigation involving our independent distributor model, could impair our ability to make, move or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events and disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.  Product removals, damaged product or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations. We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings alleging that the consumption of any of our products causes or caused injury, illness or death. Any such product removal, damaged product or an adverse result in any litigation related to such a product removal or damaged product could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results in future periods, depending on the costs of the product removal from the market, the destruction of product inventory, diversion of management time and attention, contractual and other claims made by customers that we supply, loss of key customers, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if our customers or consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products. During fiscal years 2018 and 2019, we have been required, and may be required in future periods, to remove certain of our products from the market should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged, including as a result of inferior ingredients provided by any of our suppliers. Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability.We expect consolidations among our retail and foodservice customers to continue. If this trend continues and our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. In addition, these pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. Our margins and profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.14 Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us, the distributors, and the customers’ other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, reducing shelf space for our products, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by large customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a large customer’s demands, we could lose that customer’s business, which also could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.Increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.Pension, health care, and workers’ compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in pension, health care or workers’ compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.We have risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the company’s liquidity.The company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees maintained under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets. During fiscal 2018, the company adopted a de-risking investment strategy for its pension assets in Plan No. 1 and the termination of Plan No. 1 is expected to occur by May 2020.  The termination of Plan No. 1 has resulted in a short-term conservative investment outlook, while Plan No. 2 is still managed as a long-term asset.  As a result of the termination, we will be required to make significant cash contributions to fund Plan No. 1’s unfunded vested benefit, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, the amount of which will depend on the lump sum offer participation rate of eligible participants.  Based on the estimated value of assets held in the plan, the company currently estimates that a cash contribution of approximately $17.0 million to $35.0 million will be required to fully fund the plan’s liabilities at termination.  In addition, based on current assumptions of the level of lump sum distributions elected by eligible plan participants, among other assumptions, the company estimates a final non-cash settlement charge of approximately $125.0 million to $143.0 million will be triggered in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, the likelihood of the company being required to make larger contributions will increase, which could impact our liquidity. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of larger required contributions increases. Adverse developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  We may be adversely impacted if our IT systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.The efficient operation of our business depends on our IT systems. We rely on our IT systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our IT systems (including those provided to us by third parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.15 In addition, our IT systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees.Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn and wheat. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can reduce crop size and crop quality, which in turn could reduce our supplies of raw materials, lower recoveries of usable raw materials, increase the prices of our raw materials, increase our cost of transporting and storing raw materials, or disrupt our production schedules.We may also be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our production and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.Government regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. In addition, the marketing and labeling of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing and labeling under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Uncertainty regarding labeling standards has led to customer confusions and legal challenges.In addition, our operations are subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by the Environmental Protection Agency related to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, and affect our sales.Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. Failure to comply with, or violations of, applicable laws and the regulatory requirements of one or more of these entities and agencies could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could result in increased operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results.  Executive OfficesThe address and telephone number of our principal executive offices are 1919 Flowers Circle, Thomasville, Georgia 31757, (229) 226-9110.Information about our Executive Officers The following table sets forth certain information regarding the persons who currently serve as the executive officers of Flowers Foods. 16 EXECUTIVE OFFICERS Name, Age and Office Business Experience   A.Ryals McMullianAge 50President andChief Executive Officer Mr. McMullian was elected CEO in May 2019.  Previously, Mr. McMullian served as COO from July 2018 until May 2019.  Mr. McMullian served as chief strategy officer from May 2017 to July 2018.

1,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2019-02-20,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. These risk factors are not listed in any order of significance.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.Economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.The willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products may depend in part on economic conditions. Continuing or worsening economic challenges could have a negative impact on our business. Economic uncertainty may increase pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. If any of these events occurs, or if economic conditions become unfavorable, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.14 Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.Raw materials, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening, yeast, and water, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to foreign and domestic government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices or availability. Our failure to enter into hedging or fixed price arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings.In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. The independent distributors and third-party transportation companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-margin products to lower-margin products.Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.The United States bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors’ promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.A disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We believe that our DSD distribution system is a significant competitive advantage. A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independent distributorship model, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the independent distributors, or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributors, could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to several factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 50.3% of sales during fiscal 2018. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, accounted for 20.3% of sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.15 Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation’s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution.  In particular, we have initiated under Project Centennial, among other things, (i) the integration of acquisitions or the acquisition or disposition of assets at presently targeted values, (ii) the deployment of new systems and technology, and (iii) an enhanced organizational structure.  If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing Project Centennial or one or more of our business strategies, our business could be adversely affected.Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, ingredients, and packaging. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could cause our sales, profitability, and our operating results to suffer.We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations.From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of any acquisition or divestiture depends on the company’s ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits.Acquisitions, including future acquisitions and the recently completed acquisition of Canyon, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following: •integrating the operations and business cultures of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions; •managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions; •the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the prospects of the acquired businesses; •coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations; •attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions; •creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and •expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands and the fair value of such trademarks and brands.Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diverting management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adversely affecting existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.In situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, or the expected benefits of such acquisitions or divestitures are not otherwise realized, the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted.We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.Increasing legal complexity may continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We are or could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, securities laws, employment and personal injury claims, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former distributors, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our independent distributor model and the independent contractor classification of the independent distributors, as well as litigation related to disclosure made by us in connection therewith, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business prospects and the business prospects of our distributors and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide products to customers.16 Future product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings alleging that the consumption of any of our products causes or caused injury, illness or death. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results, depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, contractual and other claims made by customers that we supply, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if our customers or consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability.If our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Meeting these demands could adversely affect our sales and profitability.Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us, the distributors, and the customers’ other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, reducing shelf space for our products, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by large customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a large customer’s demands, we could lose that customer’s business, which also could adversely affect our results of operations.Increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.Pension, health care, and workers’ compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in pension, health care or workers’ compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.We have risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the company’s liquidity.The company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees maintained under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets. During fiscal 2018, the company adopted a de-risking investment strategy for its pension assets in Plan No. 1.  The assets in Plan No. 1 are primarily invested in fixed-income assets designed to match the duration of the plan’s future benefit obligations to manage better the company’s pension liability and reduce funded status volatility.  Plan No. 1 is on a path to terminate.  The termination path for Plan No. 1 results in a short-term conservative investment outlook while Plan No. 2 is still managed as a long-term asset.  Upon completion of the process of the termination of Plan No. 1, we may be required to make significant cash contributions to fund that plan’s unfunded vested benefit, which could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, the likelihood of the company’s being required to make larger contributions will increase, which could impact our liquidity. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of larger required contributions increases. Adverse developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  17 Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, labor strikes or work stoppages, or adverse outcomes in litigation involving our independent distributor model, could impair our ability to make, move or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.We may be adversely impacted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems (including those provided to us by third parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees.Government regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. In addition, the marketing and labeling of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing and labeling under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Uncertainty regarding labeling standards has led to customer confusions and legal challenges.Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. Failure to comply with, or violations of, applicable laws and the regulatory requirements of one or more of these entities and agencies could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could result in increased operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results.  Executive OfficesThe address and telephone number of our principal executive offices are 1919 Flowers Circle, Thomasville, Georgia 31757, (229) 226-9110.18 Executive Officers of Flowers FoodsThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the persons who currently serve as the executive officers of Flowers Foods.

You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. These risk factors are not listed in any order of significance.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.13 Economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.The willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products may depend in part on economic conditions. Continuing or worsening economic challenges could have a negative impact on our business. Economic uncertainty may increase pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. If any of these events occurs, or if economic conditions become unfavorable, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.Commodities, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening and water, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to foreign and domestic government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices or availability. Our failure to enter into hedging or fixed price arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings.In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. The independent distributors and third-party transportation companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-margin products to lower-margin products.Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.The United States bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors’ promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.A disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We believe that our DSD distribution system is a significant competitive advantage. A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independent distributorship model, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the independent distributors, or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributors, could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to several factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.14 We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 48.5% of sales during fiscal 2017. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, accounted for 20% of sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation’s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution.  In particular, we have initiated under Project Centennial, among other things, (i) the integration of acquisitions or the acquisition or disposition of assets at presently targeted values, (ii) the deployment of new systems and technology, and (iii) an enhanced organizational structure.  If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing Project Centennial or one or more of our business strategies, our business could be adversely affected.Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or if we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our operating results to suffer.We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations.From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of any acquisition or divestiture depends on the company’s ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits.Acquisitions, including future acquisitions and acquisitions completed in the last several years, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following: •integrating the operations and business cultures of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions; •managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions; •the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the prospects of the acquired businesses; •coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations; •attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions; •creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and •expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands and the fair value of such trademarks and brands.Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diverting management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adversely affecting existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.15 In situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, or the expected benefits of such acquisitions or divestitures are not otherwise realized, the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted.We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.Increasing legal complexity may continue to affect our operations and results in material ways.

Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our independent distributor model and the independent contractor classification of the independent distributors, as well as litigation related to disclosure made by us in connection therewith, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business prospects and the business prospects of our distributors and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide products to customers.Future product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings alleging that the consumption of any of our products causes or caused injury, illness or death. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results, depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, contractual and other claims made by customers that we supply, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability, consumer fraud or other claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if our customers or consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability.If our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Meeting these demands could adversely affect our sales and profitability.Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us, the distributors, and the customers’ other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, reducing shelf space for our products, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by large customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a large customer’s demands, we could lose that customer’s business, which also could adversely affect our results of operations.Increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.Pension, health care, and workers’ compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in pension, health care or workers’ compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.16 We have risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the company’s liquidity.The company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees maintained under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, including the performance of our common stock, which comprised approximately 11.5% of all the pension plan assets as of December 30, 2017.If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, the likelihood of the company being required to make larger contributions will increase, which could impact our liquidity. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of larger required contributions increases. Adverse developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, labor strikes or work stoppages, or adverse outcomes in litigation involving our independent distributor model, could impair our ability to make, move or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.We may be adversely impacted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems (including those provided to us by third parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees.Government regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. In addition, the marketing and labeling of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing and labeling under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Uncertainty regarding labeling standards has led to customer confusions and legal challenges.Compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations is costly and time consuming. Failure to comply with, or violations of, applicable laws and the regulatory requirements of one or more of these entities and agencies could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could result in increased operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results.  Executive OfficesThe address and telephone number of our principal executive offices are 1919 Flowers Circle, Thomasville, Georgia 31757, (229) 226-9110.17 Executive Officers of Flowers FoodsThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the persons who currently serve as the executive officers of Flowers Foods.

10,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2017-02-23,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. These risk factors are not listed in any order of significance.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.Economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.The willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products may depend in part on economic conditions. Continuing or worsening economic challenges could have a negative impact on our business. Economic uncertainty may result in increased pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. If any of these events occurs, or if unfavorable economic conditions continue or worsen, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.Commodities, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening, and water which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to foreign and domestic government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices or availability. Our failure to enter into hedging arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings.In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. The independent distributors and third-party transportation companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or 13 results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-margin products to lower-margin products.Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.The United States bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors’ promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.A disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We believe that our DSD distribution system is a significant competitive advantage. A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independent distributorship program, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the independent distributors, or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributors could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 46.8% of sales during fiscal 2016. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, accounted for 19.6% of sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter into long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new or improved products on a timely basis we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our operating results to suffer.14 We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations.From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of any acquisition or divestiture depends on the company’s ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits.Acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following: •integrating the operations and business cultures of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions; •managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions; •the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the prospects of the acquired businesses; •coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations; •attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions; •creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and •expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands and the fair value of such trademarks and brands.Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.In situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, or the expected benefits of such acquisitions or divestitures are not otherwise realized, the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted.We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.Increasing legal complexity may continue to affect our operations and results in material ways. We are or could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, securities laws, employment and personal injury claims, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former distributors, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our independent distributor model and the independent contractor classification of the independent distributors, as well as litigation related to disclosure made by us in connection therewith, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business prospects and the business prospects of our distributors and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide products to customers.  Changes in the Administration may impact fiscal and tax policies that may affect our business. The new Administration has called for substantial change to fiscal and tax policies, which may include comprehensive tax reform. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our business. However, it is possible that these changes could adversely affect our business. It is likely that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by, the changes.Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales and profitability.If our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Meeting these demands could adversely affect our sales and profitability.Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us, the distributors, and the customers’ other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and 15 dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, reducing shelf space for our products, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by major customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a significant customer’s demands, we could lose that customer’s business, which also could adversely affect our results of operations.Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation’s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of these strategies, our business could be adversely affected.Increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.Pension, health care, and workers’ compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in pension, health care or workers’ compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.We have risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the company’s liquidity.The company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees maintained under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, including the performance of our common stock, which comprised approximately 12.1% of all the pension plan assets as of December 31, 2016.If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, the likelihood of the company being required to make larger contributions will increase which could impact our liquidity. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of larger required contributions increases. Adverse developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics, labor strikes or work stoppages, or adverse outcomes in litigation involving our independent distributor model could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.Future product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results, depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity 16 surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.We may be adversely impacted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes.

7,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2016-02-24,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.Economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.The willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products depends in part on economic conditions. In recent years, economic conditions were significantly strained in the United States. Continuing or worsening economic challenges could have a negative impact on our business. Economic uncertainty may result in increased pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products. In addition, changes in tax or interest rates, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. If any of these events occurs, or if unfavorable economic conditions continue or worsen, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.Commodities, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening, and water which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices or availability of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices or availability. Our failure to enter into hedging arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings.In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. The independent distributors and third-party transportation companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these potential cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-margin products to lower-margin products.Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.The United States bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors’ promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.A disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution model could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, litigation or one or more adverse rulings by courts or regulatory or governmental bodies in various jurisdictions regarding our independent distributorship model, including actions or decisions that could affect the independent contractor classifications of the independent distributors, or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributors could materially and negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.9 The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 43.5% of our sales during fiscal 2015. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sam’s Club, accounted for 19.3% of our sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter into long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new or improved products on a timely basis we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our operating results to suffer.We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations.From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. In fiscal 2015, we acquired DKB and Alpine and in fiscal 2013 we acquired the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, certain assets and the Sara Lee trademark licenses from BBU in California, and a bun line in Modesto, California. The success of these acquisitions, or any other acquisition or divestiture depends on the company’s ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits.Acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following: ·integrating the operations of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions; ·managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions; ·the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the integration process; ·coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations; ·integrating different business cultures; ·attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions; ·creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and ·integrating information, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems.10 Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.In situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, the company’s business or financial results could be negatively impacted.This risk includes our expectations about the performance of acquired trademarks and brands. If we are unable to implement our growth strategies for these acquired intangible assets as expected, it could adversely impact the carrying value of the acquired brands. The fair value of the trademarks could be less than our carrying value if any of our four material assumptions in our fair value analysis: (a) weighted average cost of capital; (b) long-term sales growth rates; (c) forecasted operating margins; and (d) market multiples do not meet our expectations, thereby requiring us to record an asset impairment.We are subject to increasing legal complexity and could be party to litigation that may adversely affect our business.Increasing legal complexity may negatively affect our operations and results in material ways. We could be subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations, employment and personal injury claims, disputes with current or former suppliers, claims by current or former independent distributors, and intellectual property claims (including claims that we infringed another party’s trademarks, copyrights, or patents). Inconsistent standards imposed by governmental authorities can adversely affect our business and increase our exposure to litigation. Litigation involving our independent distributor model and the independent contractor classification of the independent distributors, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of the independent distributors and subject us to incremental liability. We are also subject to the legal and compliance risks associated with privacy, data collection, protection and management, in particular as it relates to information we collect when we provide products to customers.Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales and profitability.If our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Meeting these demands could adversely affect our sales and profitability.Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us and their other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by major customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a significant customer’s demands, we could lose that customer’s business, which also could adversely affect our results of operations.Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nation’s leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of these strategies, our business could be adversely affected.Increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability.Pension, health care, and workers’ compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase in pension, health care or workers’ compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptions determined by management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.11 We have risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the company’s liquidity.The company has trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees maintained under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”). The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, including the performance of our common stock, which comprised approximately 11.8% of all the pension plan assets as of January 2, 2016.If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, the likelihood of the company being required to make larger contributions will increase which could impact our liquidity. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of larger required contributions increases. Adverse developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics or labor strikes, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.Future product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results, depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.We may be adversely impacted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems (including those provided to us by third parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting, and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. If we are unable to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks and other information security breaches, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, be subject to litigation or incur remediation costs or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers, suppliers or employees.Government regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. In addition, the marketing and labeling of food products has come under increased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing and labeling under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Uncertainty regarding labeling standards has led to customer confusions and legal challenges.Compliance with federal, state and local regulations is costly and time consuming. Failure to comply with, or violations of, applicable laws and the regulatory requirements of one or more of these agencies could subject us to civil remedies, including fines, 12 injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions, any of which could result in increased operating costs and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legal proceedings or claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results.Executive OfficesThe address and telephone number of our principal executive offices are 1919 Flowers Circle, Thomasville, Georgia 31757, (229) 226-9110.13 Executive Officers of Flowers FoodsThe following table sets forth certain information regarding the persons who currently serve as the executive officers of Flowers Foods.

The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.   9 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsEconomic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adverselyimpact our sales and operating profit.  The willingness of our customers and consumers to purchase our products depends inpart on economic conditions. In recent years, economic conditions were significantly strained in the United States. Continuing or worsening economic challenges could have a negative impact on our business. Economic uncertainty may result inincreased pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-margin products. In addition, changes in tax or interestrates, whether due to recession, financial and credit market disruptions or other reasons, could negatively impact us. If any of these events occurs, or if unfavorable economic conditions continue or worsen, our sales and profitability could beadversely affected.  Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact ourprofitability.  Commodities, such as flour, sweeteners, and shortening, which are used in our bakery products, are subjectto price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices of rawmaterials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, thesestrategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices. Our failure to enter into effective hedging arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the priceof these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings.  In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane forfiring ovens. Our independent distributors and third-party shipping companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy andregulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be noassurance that we can cover these cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-margin products to lower-margin products. Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability. The United States bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial,marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised branded products, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on productavailability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricingpressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.  The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability. We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devoteresources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about ourproducts (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain the quality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. Our marketing investments maynot prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.   10 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe rely on several large customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss ofone of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  We have several largecustomers that account for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 43.9% of our sales during fiscal 2014. Our largestcustomer, Walmart/Sams Club, accounted for 19.5% of our sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter into long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality,consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers mayface financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. Disputes with significant suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers. If our sales to one or more of thesecustomers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which couldhave an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to respondto current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients. Introduction of new products and product extensionsrequires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on that investment will be less than anticipated andour strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new or improved products on atimely basis we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our operating results to suffer. We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations. From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. In fiscal 2013, we acquired the Acquired HostessBread Assets, certain assets and the Sara Lee trademark licenses from BBU in California, and certain assets related to a bun line in Modesto, California. The success of these acquisitions, or any other acquisition or divestiture depends onthe companys ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits. Acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves asignificant degree of difficulty, including the following:      integrating the operations of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions;     managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions;     the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the integration process;     coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations;     integrating different business cultures;      attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions;     creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and     integrating information, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems.   11 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsDivestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures alsopresent unique financial and operational risks, including diversion of management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships withsuppliers and customers.  In situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, thecompanys business or financial results could be negatively impacted.  This risk includes our expectations about theperformance of acquired trademarks and brands. If we are unable to implement our growth strategies for these acquired intangible assets as expected, it could adversely impact the carrying value of the acquired brands. The fair value of thetrademarks could be less than our carrying value if any of our four material assumptions in our fair value analysis: (a) weighted average cost of capital; (b) long-term sales growth rates; (c) forecasted operating margins; and(d) market multiples do not meet our expectations, thereby requiring us to record an asset impairment.  Consolidationin the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales and profitability.  If our retail and foodservice customerscontinue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Meeting these demands could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations. From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us andtheir other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers, supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength.Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, and requiringproduct delivery with shorter lead times. These business changes may involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer- supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by major customers may be costly and may havean adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail to meet a significant customers demands, we could lose that customers business, which also could adversely affect our results of operations. Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business. We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nations leading producers and marketers of bakeryproducts available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of these strategies, our business could be adversely affected. Increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability. Pension, health care, and workers compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase inpension, health care or workers compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptionsdetermined by management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in thediscount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (includingemployee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.  We have risks related to our pension plans,which could impact the companys liquidity.  The company has trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension planscovering certain employees maintained under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The funding   12 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsobligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, including the performance of our common stock, which comprises approximately 10.3% of all the pensionplan assets as of January 3, 2015.  If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, thelikelihood of the company being required to make larger contributions will increase which could impact our liquidity. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirementscan change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of larger required contributions increases. Adversedevelopments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  Adisruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  We believe that our DSD distribution system is a significant competitive advantage. A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, an adverse ruling by regulatory orgovernmental bodies regarding our independent distributorship program or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributors could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cashflows.  Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities,incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, weather or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of oursuppliers due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics or labor strikes, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or naturaldisasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage suchevents if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.  Future productrecalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.  We may be required to recall certain of ourproducts should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. Aproduct recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results, depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, competitive reaction and consumerattitudes. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could beadversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.  We maybe adversely impacted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.  The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain,order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems (including those provided to us by third parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing,collecting, and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruptionfrom circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures,   13 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementssecurity breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or other confidential data), and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness or financial results.  Government regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financialcondition.  As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling,storage, and distribution are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. Failure to comply with, or violations of, the regulatory requirements of one or more of these agencies can result in a varietyof sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory withdrawal of products from store shelves, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the marketing of food products has come underincreased scrutiny in recent years, and the food industry has been subject to an increasing number of legal proceedings and claims relating to alleged false or deceptive marketing under federal, state or local laws or regulations. Legal proceedingsor claims related to our marketing could damage our reputation and/or adversely affect our business or financial results. Climate change or changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws or regulations involving government regulations to limit carbondioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products and have anadverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  There is growing concern that carbondioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negativeeffect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as corn, wheat, and soybeans. We may also be subjected to decreasedavailability or less favorable pricing for water as a result of such change, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may disrupt the productivity of ourfacilities or the operation of our supply chain.  The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional,federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Legislation or regulationaffecting these inputs could materially affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition since they could affect our ability to procure our commodity needs at costs we currently experience and may require additional unplannedcapital expenditures. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience significantincreases in our costs of operation and delivery.  Failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual propertyrights could impact our competitiveness.  We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect ourintellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or, where appropriate,license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. We cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. Our failure to perfect or successfully assertour intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and Georgia law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor.  Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and Georgia law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit any possible future acquisition of our company if not approved by our Board of Directors. Thiscould occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial number or even a majority of   14 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsour shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of ourBoard of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions in our organizational documents that could delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition include the following:     A classified Board of Directors, subject to the Board of Directors determination, on November 21, 2014, to seek shareholder approval of a proposalto declassify its board of directors at the 2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders;      The requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause;     Specified requirements for calling special meetings of shareholders;     The ability to issue preferred stock, which would be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; and     The ability of the Board of Directors to consider the interests of various constituencies, including our employees, customers, creditors, and the localcommunity.    *On November 21, 2014, the Board of Directors determined that the company will seek shareholder approval of a proposal to declassify its board of directors at the2015 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  Our articles of incorporation also permit the Board of Directors to issueshares of preferred stock with such designations, powers, preferences and rights as it determines, without any further vote or action by our shareholders.

9,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2014-02-19,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harmour business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  Economic conditions may negatively impact demandfor our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.  The willingness of our customers andconsumers to purchase our products depends in part on economic conditions. In recent years, economic conditions were significantly strained in the United States. Continuing or worsening economic challenges could have a negative impact on ourbusiness. Economic uncertainty may result in increased pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products, limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, and reduce sales of higher margin products or shift our product mix to low-marginproducts. If any of these events occurs, or if unfavorable economic conditions continue or worsen, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.  Commodities, such as flour, sweeteners, and shortening, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policiesand regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the   10 Table of Contentsprices of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage theimpact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices. Our failure to enter into effective hedging arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in thecost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings. In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas or propane for firing ovens. Our independent distributors and third-party shippingcompanies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. The cost of fuel may fluctuate widely due to economic and political conditions, government policy and regulation, war, or other unforeseen circumstances. Substantial futureincreases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these cost increases through future pricingactions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-margin products to lower-margin products.  We may be adversely impacted if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues. The efficient operation of our business depends on our information technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems toeffectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technology systems (including those provided to us by third parties) to perform as weanticipate could disrupt our business and could result in billing, collecting, and ordering errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer. In addition, ourinformation technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches or intrusions (including theft of customer, consumer or otherconfidential data), and viruses. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results.  Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability.  The UnitedStates bakery industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors in these categories all have substantial financial, marketing, and other resources. In most product categories, we compete not only with other widely advertised brandedproducts, but also with store branded products that are generally sold at lower prices. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effective promotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. Weexperience price pressure from time to time due to competitors promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverse economic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales,margins, profits and market share.  We rely on several large customers for a significant portion of our sales and the lossof one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  We have severallarge customers that account for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 43.5% of our sales during fiscal 2013. Our largestcustomer, Walmart/Sams Club, accounted for 20.1% of our sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter into long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality,consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. Additionally, our customers mayface financial or other difficulties that may impact their operations and their purchases from us. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results ofoperations.   11 Table of ContentsWe may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions anddivestitures and integrate acquired operations.  From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. Infiscal 2013, we acquired the Acquired Hostess Bread Assets, certain assets and the Sara Lee trademark licenses from BBU in California, and certain assets related to a bun line in Modesto, California. In fiscal 2012, we acquired the LepageBakeries and certain licenses to the Earthgrains brands. In fiscal 2011, we acquired Tasty Baking Company. The success of these acquisitions, or any other acquisition or divestiture depends on the companys ability to identifyopportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits.  Acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions, require us to efficiently integrate the acquired business or businesses, which involves a significant degree of difficulty, including the following:     integrating the operations of the acquired businesses while carrying on the ongoing operations of the businesses we operated prior to the acquisitions;     managing a significantly larger company than before consummation of the acquisitions;     the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations regarding the integration process;     coordinating a greater number of diverse businesses and businesses located in a greater number of geographic locations;     integrating different business cultures;      attracting and retaining the necessary personnel associated with the acquisitions;     creating uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems and controlling the costs associated with such matters; and     integrating information, purchasing, accounting, finance, sales, billing, payroll and regulatory compliance systems. Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Divestitures also present unique financial and operational risks,including diversion of management attention from the existing core business, separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. In situations where acquisitions or divestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, the companys business or financialresults could be negatively impacted.  Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales andprofitability.  If our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respectiveindustries, they may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Meeting these demands could adversely affect our sales and profitability.  Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.  From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us and their other suppliers. The growth of large mass merchandisers,supercenters and dollar stores, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power and negotiating strength. Current trends among retailers and foodservice customers includefostering high levels of competition among suppliers, demanding new products or increased promotional programs, requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices, and requiring product delivery with shorter lead times. These business changesmay involve inventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer- supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by major customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, ifwe fail to meet a significant customers demands, we could lose that customers business, which also could adversely affect our results of operations.   12 Table of ContentsOur inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business. We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nations leading producers andmarketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels of distribution. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of these strategies, our business could be adversely affected. Increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability. Pension, health care, and workers compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase inpension, health care or workers compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptionsdetermined by management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in thediscount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors. In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (includingemployee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results.  We have risks related to our pension plans,which could impact the companys liquidity.  The company has trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension planscovering certain employees maintained under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, including theperformance of our common stock, which comprises approximately 15.1% of all the pension plan assets as of December 28, 2013.  If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, the likelihood of the company being required to make larger contributions will increase which could impact our liquidity.The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact ourcontribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of larger required contributions increases. Adverse developments in any of these areas could adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. A disruption in the operation of our DSD distribution system could negatively affect our results of operations, financialcondition and cash flows.  We believe that our DSD distribution system is a significant competitive advantage. A materialnegative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, an adverse ruling by regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independent distributorship program or an adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by theindependent distributors could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Disruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities from political instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism,natural disasters, weather or labor strikes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of oursuppliers due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics or labor strikes, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Moreover, terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or naturaldisasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage suchevents if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial conditions and results of operations.   13 Table of ContentsInability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result indecreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.  Oursuccess depends, in part, on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers, including concerns of consumers regarding health and wellness, obesity, product attributes, and ingredients.Introduction of new products and product extensions requires significant development and marketing investment. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return onthat investment will be less than anticipated and our strategy to grow sales and profits with investments in marketing and innovation will be less successful. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, or wefail to introduce new or improved products on a timely basis we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our operating results to suffer.  Future product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations.  We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We also may become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it isalleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results, depending on the costs ofthe recall, the destruction of product inventory, competitive reaction and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding ourproducts could adversely affect our reputation and brand image. We also could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products. Government regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling, storage, and distribution aresubject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. Failure to comply with, or violations of, the regulatory requirements of one or more of these agencies can result in a variety of sanctions, includingmonetary fines or compulsory withdrawal of products from store shelves, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws or regulations involving government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs,capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. We use natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity in the manufacturing and distribution of our products. Legislation orregulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Legislation designed to control emissions affecting climate change could affect our ability to procure our commodity needs atcosts we currently experience and may require additional unplanned capital expenditures.  The costs of maintaining andenhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.  We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand buildingefforts. Brand value could diminish significantly due to a number of factors, including consumer perception that we have acted in an irresponsible manner, adverse publicity about our products (whether or not valid), our failure to maintain thequality of our products, the failure of our products to deliver consistently positive consumer experiences, or the products becoming unavailable to consumers. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our marketshare. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition, our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.   14 Table of ContentsFailure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual property rights couldimpact our competitiveness.  We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect our intellectualproperty rights. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or, where appropriate, licenseintellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. We cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. Our failure to perfect or successfully assert ourintellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.  Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and Georgia law may inhibit a change in control that you may favor.  Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and Georgia law contain provisions that may delay, deter or inhibit any possible future acquisition of our company if not approved by our Board of Directors. Thiscould occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial number or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are intended to encourage anyperson interested in acquiring us to negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors in connection with the transaction. Provisions in our organizational documents that could delay, deter or inhibit a future acquisition include thefollowing:      A classified Board of Directors;      The requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors for cause;     Specified requirements for calling special meetings of shareholders;     The ability to issue preferred stock, which would be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock; and     The ability of the Board of Directors to consider the interests of various constituencies, including our employees, customers, creditors, and the localcommunity.  Our articles of incorporation also permit the Board of Directors to issue shares of preferredstock with such designations, powers, preferences and rights as it determines, without any further vote or action by our shareholders.

13,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2013-02-20,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
   You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertaintiesdescribed below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our business operations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harmour business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  Economic conditions may negatively impact demandfor our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit.  In recent years, economic conditions weresignificantly strained in the United States. Continuing or worsening economic challenges could have a negative impact on our business. Economic uncertainty may result in increased pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products and/or limitour ability to increase or maintain prices. If either of these events occur, or if unfavorable economic conditions continue, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability. Commodities, such as flour, sweeteners, and shortening, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The costof these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any substantial change in the prices of raw materials may have an adverseimpact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage the impact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate toovercome increases in market prices. Our failure to enter into effective hedging arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in the cost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials andsignificantly affect our earnings.  In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas for firing ovens. Our independentdistributors and third-party shipping companies are dependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financialcondition or results of operations. There can be no assurance that we can cover these cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-marginbranded products to lower-margin store brands.  We may be adversely impacted if our information technology systems fail toperform adequately, including with respect to cybersecurity issues.  The efficient operation of our business depends on ourinformation technology systems. We rely on our information technology systems to effectively manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes. The failure of our information technologysystems (including those provided to us by third parties) to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and resultsof operations to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, security breaches, and viruses. Any suchdamage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.   10 Table of ContentsCompetition could adversely impact revenues and profitability. The United States bakery industry is highly competitive. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effectivepromotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverseeconomic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.  We rely onseveral large customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of one of our large customers couldadversely affect our results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 45.1% of our sales during fiscal 2012. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sams Club, accounted for 20.7% of our sales during this period. These customers do nottypically enter into long-term sales contracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, includingspace currently used for our products, for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results ofoperations.  Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales and profitability. If our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, theymay demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Meeting these demands could adversely affect our sales and profitability.  Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.  From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us and their other suppliers. These business changes may involveinventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by major customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail tomeet a significant customers demands, we could lose that customers business, which also could adversely affect our results of operations.  Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.

The funding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, including the performance of our common stock, whichcomprises approximately 12.7% of all the pension plan assets as of December 29, 2012.

Inability to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences may result in decreased demand for our products, which could have an adverse impact on our future growth and operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to respond to current market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietaryhabits of consumers. If we fail to anticipate, identify, or react to changes in consumer preferences, we could experience reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our operating results to suffer. Future product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our results of operations. We may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated, spoiled, tampered with or damaged. We alsomay become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. A product recall or an adverse result in any such litigation could have a material adverse effect onour operating and financial results. Even if a product liability or consumer fraud claim is unsuccessful or without merit, the negative publicity surrounding such assertions regarding our products could adversely affect our reputation and brandimage. We also could be adversely affected if consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety and quality of our products.   12 Table of ContentsGovernment regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and financialcondition.  As a producer and marketer of food items, our production processes, product quality, packaging, labeling,storage, and distribution are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local government entities and agencies. Failure to comply with, or violations of, the regulatory requirements of one or more of these agencies can result in a varietyof sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory withdrawal of products from store shelves, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws or regulations involving government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and othergreenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products and have an adverse effect on ourresults of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  We use natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity in themanufacturing and distribution of our products. Legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Legislation designed to control emissions affecting climate changecould affect our ability to procure our commodity needs at costs we currently experience and may require additional unplanned capital expenditures.  We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations. From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures. The success of any acquisition or divestiture depends on thecompanys ability to identify opportunities that help us meet our strategic objectives, consummate a transaction on favorable contractual terms, and achieve expected returns and other financial benefits. Acquisitions require us to efficientlyintegrate the acquired business to achieve the expected returns. Divestitures have operational risks that may include impairment charges. Acquisitions or divestitures present unique financial and operational risks, including diversion of managementattention from the existing core business, integrating or separating personnel and financial data and other systems, and adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers. In situations where acquisitions ordivestitures are not successfully implemented or completed, the companys business or financial results could be negatively impacted.  The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands are increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability. We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devoteresources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts. Our marketing investments may not prove successful in maintaining or increasing our market share. If we are not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition, our revenuesand profitability could be adversely affected.  Failure to maximize or to successfully assert our intellectual propertyrights could impact our competitiveness.  We rely on trademark, trade secret, patent and copyright laws to protect ourintellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that these intellectual property rights will be maximized or that they can be successfully asserted. There is a risk that we will not be able to obtain and perfect our own or, where appropriate,license intellectual property rights necessary to support new product introductions. We cannot be sure that these rights, if obtained, will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged in the future. Our failure to perfect or successfully assertour intellectual property rights could make us less competitive and could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

8,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2012-02-29,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this report, inconsidering our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our businessoperations. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  Economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating profit. In recent years, economic conditions were significantly strained in the United States. Continuing or worsening economic challenges couldhave a negative impact on our business. Economic uncertainty may result in increased pressure to reduce the prices of some of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices. If either of these events occur, or if unfavorableeconomic conditions continue, our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.  Increases in costs and/or shortagesof raw materials, fuels and utilities could adversely impact our profitability.  Commodities, such as flour, sweeteners,and shortening, which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations. The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government policies and regulations, weather conditions, domestic and international demand, or otherunforeseen circumstances. Any substantial increase in the prices of raw materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability. We enter into forward purchase agreements and other derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage theimpact of such volatility in raw materials prices; however, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome increases in market prices. Our failure to enter into effective hedging arrangements or any decrease in the availability or increase in thecost of these agreements and instruments could increase the price of these raw materials and significantly affect our earnings. In addition, we are dependent upon natural gas for firing ovens. Our independent distributors and third-party shipping companies aredependent upon gasoline and diesel for their vehicles. Substantial future increases in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition or results of operations. There can be noassurance that we can cover these cost increases through future pricing actions. Also, as a result of these pricing actions, consumers could purchase less or move from purchasing high-margin branded products to lower-margin store brands. Competition could adversely impact revenues and profitability. The United States bakery industry is highly competitive. Competition is based on product availability, product quality, price, effectivepromotions, and the ability to target changing consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to time due to competitors promotional activity and other pricing efforts. This pricing pressure is particularly strong during adverseeconomic periods. Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins, profits and market share.  We rely onseveral large customers for a significant portion of our sales and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales, and the loss of one of our large customers couldadversely affect our results of operations. Our top ten customers accounted for 45.6%   10 Table of Contentsof our sales during fiscal 2011. Our largest customer, Walmart/Sams Club, accounted for 21.6% of our sales during this period. These customers do not typically enter into long-term salescontracts, and instead make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality, consumer demand, and customer service performance. At any time, they may use more of their shelf space, including space currently used for our products,for store branded products or for products from other suppliers. If our sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales and profitability. If our retail and foodservice customers continue to grow larger due to consolidation in their respective industries, they may demand lowerpricing and increased promotional programs. Meeting these demands could adversely affect our margins, and therefore our sales and profitability.  Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely affect our results of operations.  From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine their business practices and impose new or revised requirements on us and their other suppliers. These business changes may involveinventory practices, logistics, or other aspects of the customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements imposed by major customers may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our margins and profitability. However, if we fail tomeet a significant customers demands, we could lose that customers business, which also could adversely affect our results of operations.  Our inability to execute our business strategy could adversely affect our business.  We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position as one of the nations leading producers and marketers of bakery products available to customers through multiple channels ofdistribution. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of these strategies, our business could be adversely affected.  We have risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the companys liquidity.  The company has trusteed, noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees maintained under the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Thefunding obligations for our pension plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets, including the performance of our common stock, which comprises approximately 11.6% of all the pension plan assets as of December 31, 2011. If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns that are expected, the likelihood of the company being requiredto make larger contributions will increase which could impact our liquidity. The equity markets can be, and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively shortperiods of time. Similarly, changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood of larger required contributions increases. Adverse developments in any of these areas could adverselyaffect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.  A disruption in the operation of our DSD distributionsystem could negatively affect our results of operations financial condition and cash flows.  We believe that our DSDdistribution system is a significant competitive advantage. A material negative change in our relationship with the independent distributors, an adverse ruling by regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independent distributorship program oran adverse judgment against the company for actions taken by the independent distributors could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.   11 Table of ContentsDisruption in our supply chain or distribution capabilities could have an adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our ability to make, move and sell products is critical toour success. Damage or disruption to our manufacturing or distribution capabilities, or the manufacturing or distribution capabilities of our suppliers due to weather, natural disaster, fire or explosion, terrorism, pandemics or labor strikes, couldimpair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financialconditions and results of operations.  The costs of maintaining and enhancing the value and awareness of our brands areincreasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.  We rely on the success of ourwell-recognized brand names and we intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand building efforts.

Failure to comply with, or violations of, the regulatory requirements of one or more of these agencies can result in a variety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory withdrawal of products from store shelves, anyof which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Any business disruption due topolitical instability, armed hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could adversely impact our financial performance.  Terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or natural disasters that may occur within or outside the U.S. may disrupt manufacturing, labor, and other business operations. In the eventof such incidents, our business and financial performance could be adversely affected.   12 Table of ContentsChanges in or new interpretations of applicable laws or regulations involving governmentregulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations that could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution ofour products and have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

Legislation or regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Legislation designed tocontrol emissions affecting climate change could affect our ability to procure our commodity needs at costs we currently experience and may require additional unplanned capital expenditures. Increases in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our profitability. Pension, health care, and workers compensation costs are increasing and will likely continue to do so. Any substantial increase inpension, health care or workers compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our profitability. The company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial valuations, which include key assumptionsdetermined by management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in the number of plan participants, changes in thediscount rate, changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of contributions to the plan, and other factors.  In addition, legislation or regulations involving labor and employment and employee benefit plans (including employee health care benefits and costs) may impact our operational results. We may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute acquisitions and divestitures and integrate acquired operations. From time to time, the company undertakes acquisitions or divestitures.

15,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2011-02-23,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     You should carefully consider the risks described below,    together with all of the other information included in this    report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and    uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us.    Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or    that we currently deem insignificant, may also impair our    business operations. The occurrence of any of the following    risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of    operations. Current    economic conditions may negatively impact demand for our    products, which could adversely impact our sales and operating    profit.     Economic conditions have deteriorated significantly throughout    the United States in recent years and these difficult conditions    may continue to exist for the foreseeable future. This    deterioration could have a negative impact on our business.    Economic uncertainty may result in increased pressure to reduce    the prices for some of our products    and/or limit    our ability to increase or maintain prices. If any of these    events occur, or if the unfavorable economic conditions    continue, our sales and profitability could be adversely    affected. Increases    in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities    could cause costs to increase.     Commodities, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening and eggs,    which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price    fluctuations. Any substantial increase in the prices of raw    materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability.    Agricultural commodity prices reached all time high levels    during 2007 and the first half of 2008 before declining during    2009. Commodity prices began to rise in the second half of 2010    and are expected to continue rising during 2011.     The cost of these inputs may fluctuate widely due to government    policy and regulation, weather conditions, domestic and    international demand or other unforeseen circumstances. In    addition, we are dependent upon natural gas and propane for    firing ovens. The independent distributors and third party    shipping companies we use are dependent upon gasoline and diesel    as fuel for distribution vehicles. Substantial future increases    in prices for, or shortages of, these fuels could have a    material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.    The company cannot guarantee that it can cover these cost    increases through future pricing actions. Additionally, as a    result of these pricing actions consumers could move from the    purchase of high margin branded products to lower margin store    brands. Competition    could adversely impact revenues and profitability.     The United States bakery industry is highly competitive.    Competition is based on product availability, product quality,    price, effective promotions and the ability to target changing    consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to    time as a result of our competitors promotional and other    pricing efforts. Increased competition could result in reduced    sales, margins, profits and market share. We rely    on a few large customers for a significant portion of our sales    and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely    affect our financial condition and results of    operations.     We have several large customers that account for a significant    portion of our sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 46.5%    of our sales during fiscal 2010. Our largest customer,    Wal-Mart/Sams Club, accounted for 21.8% of our sales    during this period. The loss of one of our large customers could    adversely affect our results of operations. These customers do    not typically enter into long-term sales contracts, and make    purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product    quality, consumer demand and customer service performance. They    may in the future use more of their shelf space, including space    currently used for our products, for store branded products or    products of other suppliers. If our sales to one or more of    these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect    our business.    9Table of ContentsConsolidation    in the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales    and profitability.     As our customers, including mass merchandisers grow larger they    may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs.    Meeting these demands could adversely affect our margins. Our large    customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely    affect our results of operations.     From time to time, our large customers may re-evaluate or refine    their business practices and impose new or revised requirements    upon their suppliers, including us. These business demands may    relate to inventory practices, logistics or other aspects of the    customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements    imposed by significant customers may be costly and may have an    adverse effect on our results of operations. However, if we fail    to meet a significant customers demands, we could lose    that customers business, which could adversely affect our    results of operations. Our    ability to execute our business strategy could affect our    business.     We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position    as one of the nations leading producers and marketers of    bakery products available to customers through multiple channels    of distribution. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or    executing one or more of these strategies, our business could be    adversely affected. Increases    in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse    effects on our profitability.     Pension, health care and workers compensation costs have    been increasing and will likely continue to increase. Any    substantial increase in pension, health care or workers    compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our    profitability. The company records pension costs and the    liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial    valuations, which include key assumptions determined by    management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the    future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual    amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in    the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate,    changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in the    level of contributions to the plan and other factors. We have    risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the    companys liquidity.     The company has trusteed, noncontributory defined pension plans    covering certain employees maintained under the    U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974    (ERISA). The funding obligations for our pension    plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets,    including the performance of our common stock, which comprises    approximately 13.0% of all the pension plan assets as of    January 1, 2011.     If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns    that are expected, the likelihood of the company being required    to make contributions will increase. The equity markets can be,    and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our    estimate of future contribution requirements can change    dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly,    changes in interest rates can impact our contribution    requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood    of required contributions in the future increases. A    disruption in the operation of our DSD system could negatively    affect our results of operations and financial    condition.     We believe that our DSD distribution system is a significant    competitive advantage. A material negative change in our    relations with the independent distributors, an adverse ruling    by regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independent    distributorship program or an adverse judgment against the    company for actions taken by the independent distributors could    materially affect our results of operation and financial    condition. We rely    on the value of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and    enhancing the awareness of our brands are increasing, which    could have an adverse impact on our revenues and    profitability.     We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names. We    intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to    devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand    building efforts. If we are not able to successfully maintain    our brand recognition, our revenues and profitability could be    adversely affected.    10Table of ContentsInability    to anticipate changes in consumer preferences may result in    decreased demand for products, which could have an adverse    impact on our future growth and operating results.     Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to current    market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of    consumers. Consumer preferences change, and our failure to    anticipate, identify or react to these changes could result in    reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our    operating results to suffer. Future    product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our    results of operations.     We may be required to recall certain of our products should they    be mislabeled, contaminated or damaged. We also may become    involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that    the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or    death. A product recall or an adverse result in any such    litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating    and financial results. We also could be adversely affected if    consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety    and quality of our products. Government    regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and    financial condition.     As a producer and marketer of food items, we are subject to    regulation by various federal, state and local government    entities and agencies with respect to production processes,    product quality, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution.    Failure to comply with, or violations of, the regulatory    requirements of one or more of these agencies can result in a    variety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory    withdrawal of products from store shelves. Any    business disruption due to political instability, armed    hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could    adversely impact our financial performance.     If terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or    natural disasters occur in the U.S. or other locations,    such events may disrupt manufacturing, labor and other aspects    of our business. In the event of such incidents, our business    and financial performance could be adversely affected. Changes    in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations    thereof, including increased government regulations to limit    carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of    concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance    costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for    us, which could affect our profitability or impede the    production or distribution of our products, which could affect    our results of operations and financial condition.     We use natural gas, diesel fuel, and electricity in the    manufacturing and distribution of our products. Legislation or    regulation affecting these inputs could materially affect our    profitability. Legislation designed to control emissions    affecting climate change could affect our ability to procure our    commodity needs at costs we currently experience and may require    additional unplanned capital expenditures. Our    articles of incorporation, bylaws, and shareholder rights plan    and Georgia law may inhibit a change in control that you may    favor.     Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, shareholder rights    plan and Georgia law contain provisions that may delay, deter or    inhibit a future acquisition of us if not approved by our Board    of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are    offered an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial    number or even a majority of our shareholders believe the    takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are    intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to    negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors    in connection with the transaction. Provisions in our    organizational documents that could delay, deter or inhibit a    future acquisition include the following:           a classified Board of Directors;           the requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors    for cause;           specified requirements for calling special meetings of    shareholders; and    11Table of Contents           the ability of the Board of Directors to consider the interests    of various constituencies, including our employees, clients and    creditors and the local community.     Our articles of incorporation also permit the Board of Directors    to issue shares of preferred stock with such designations,    powers, preferences and rights as it determines, without any    further vote or action by our shareholders. In addition, we have    in place a shareholders rights plan that will trigger a    dilutive issuance of common stock upon substantial purchases of    our common stock by a third party that are not approved by the    Board of Directors. "

There have    been no new participants in the companys defined benefit    plan since December 31, 1998. Effective December 31,    2005, the company froze benefits in its primary defined benefit    pension plan. As a result of the downturn in equity markets    during 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, the assets of the    companys pension plans decreased significantly and, as a    result of this decrease, pension costs increased in 2009. We have    risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the    companys liquidity.     The company has trusteed, noncontributory defined pension plans    covering certain employees maintained under the    U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974    (ERISA).

These customers do    not typically enter into long-term sales contracts, and make    purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product    quality, consumer demand and customer service performance. They    may in the future use more of their shelf space, including space    currently used for our products, for private label products or    products of other suppliers. If our sales to one or more of    these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect    our business. Consolidation    in the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales    and profitability.     As our customers, including mass merchandisers grow larger they    may demand lower pricing and increased promotional programs.    Meeting these demands could adversely affect our margins. Our large    customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely    affect our results of operations.     From time to time, our large customers, including    Wal-Mart/Sams Club, may re-evaluate or refine their    business practices and impose new or revised requirements upon    their suppliers, including us. These business demands may relate    to inventory practices, logistics or other aspects of the    customer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirements    imposed by significant customers may be costly and may have an    adverse effect on our results of operations. However, if we fail    to meet a significant customers demands, we could lose    that customers business, which could adversely affect our    results of operations. Competition    could adversely impact revenues and profitability.     The United States bakery industry is highly competitive.    Competition is based on product availability, product quality,    price, effective promotions and the ability to target changing    consumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time to    time as a result of our competitors promotional efforts.    Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins,    profits and market share. Our    ability to execute our business strategy could affect our    business.     We employ various operating strategies to maintain our position    as one of the nations leading producers and marketers of    bakery products available to customers through multiple channels    of distribution. If we are unsuccessful in implementing or    executing one or more of these strategies, our business could be    adversely affected. Increases    in employee and employee-related costs could have adverse    effects on our profitability.     Pension, health care and workers compensation costs have    been increasing and will likely continue to increase. Any    substantial increase in pension, health care or workers    compensation costs may have an adverse impact on our    profitability. The company records pension costs and the    liabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarial    valuations, which include key assumptions determined by    management. Material changes in pension costs may occur in the    future due to changes in these assumptions. Future annual    amounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes in    the number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate,    changes in the    10Table of Contents    expected long-term rate of return, changes in the level of    contributions to the plan and other factors. There have been no    new participants in the companys defined benefit plan    since December 31, 1998. Effective December 31, 2005,    the company froze benefits in its primary defined benefit    pension plan. As a result of the downturn in equity markets    during 2008, the assets of the companys pension plans    decreased significantly and, as a result of this decrease,    pension costs will increase in 2009. We have    risks related to our pension plans, which could impact the    companys liquidity.     The company has trusteed, noncontributory defined pension plans    covering certain employees maintained under the    U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974    (ERISA). The funding obligations for our pension    plans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets,    including the performance of our common stock, which comprises    approximately 13.2% of all the pension plan assets as of    January 3, 2009.     If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returns    that are expected, the likelihood of the company being required    to make contributions will increase. The equity markets can be,    and recently have been, very volatile, and therefore our    estimate of future contribution requirements can change    dramatically in relatively short periods of time. Similarly,    changes in interest rates can impact our contribution    requirements. In a low interest rate environment, the likelihood    of required contributions in the future increases. A    disruption in the operation of our DSD system could negatively    affect our results of operations and financial    condition.     We believe that our DSD distribution system is a significant    competitive advantage. A material negative change in our    relations with the independent distributors, an adverse ruling    by regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independent    distributorship program or an adverse judgment against the    company for actions taken by the independent distributors could    materially affect our results of operation and financial    condition. We rely    on the value of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and    enhancing the awareness of our brands are increasing, which    could have an adverse impact on our revenues and    profitability.     We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names. We    intend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing to    devote resources to advertising, marketing and other brand    building efforts. If we are not able to successfully maintain    our brand recognition, our revenues and profitability could be    adversely affected. Inability    to anticipate changes in consumer preferences may result in    decreased demand for products, which could have an adverse    impact on our future growth and operating results.     Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to current    market trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of    consumers. Consumer preferences change, and our failure to    anticipate, identify or react to these changes could result in    reduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause our    operating results to suffer. Future    product recalls or safety concerns could adversely impact our    results of operations.     We may be required to recall certain of our products should they    be mislabeled, contaminated or damaged. We also may become    involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that    the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or    death. A product recall or an adverse result in any such    litigation could have a material adverse effect on our operating    and financial results. We also could be adversely affected if    consumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safety    and quality of our products. Government    regulation could adversely impact our results of operations and    financial condition.     As a producer and marketer of food items, we are subject to    regulation by various federal, state and local government    entities and agencies with respect to production processes,    product quality, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution.    Failure to comply with, or violations of, the regulatory    requirements of one or more of these agencies can result in a    variety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory    withdrawal of products from store shelves. In addition, future    regulation by these agencies, the military action in Iraq and    the continuing threat of    11Table of Contents    terrorist attacks, could increase our commodity and service    costs and have material adverse effects on our results of    operations and financial condition. Any    business disruption due to political instability, armed    hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could    adversely impact our financial performance.     If terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or    natural disasters occur in the U.S. or other locations,    such events may disrupt manufacturing, labor and other aspects    of our business. In the event of such incidents, our business    and financial performance could be adversely affected. Our    articles of incorporation, bylaws, and shareholder rights plan    and Georgia law may inhibit a change in control that you may    favor.     Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, shareholder rights    plan and Georgia law contain provisions that may delay, deter or    inhibit a future acquisition of us if not approved by our Board    of Directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are    offered an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial    number or even a majority of our shareholders believe the    takeover is in their best interest. These provisions are    intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring us to    negotiate with and obtain the approval of our Board of Directors    in connection with the transaction. Provisions in our    organizational documents that could delay, deter or inhibit a    future acquisition include the following:           a classified Board of Directors;           the requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors    for cause;           specified requirements for calling special meetings of    shareholders; and           the ability of the Board of Directors to consider the interests    of various constituencies, including our employees, clients and    creditors and the local community.     Our articles of incorporation also permit the Board of Directors    to issue shares of preferred stock with such designations,    powers, preferences and rights as it determines, without any    further vote or action by our shareholders. In addition, we have    in place a shareholders rights plan that will trigger a    dilutive issuance of common stock upon substantial purchases of    our common stock by a third party that are not approved by the    Board of Directors. "
17,FLO,FLOWERS FOODS INC,2008-02-27,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     You should carefully consider the risks described below,    together with all of the other information included in this    report, in considering our business and prospects. The risks and    uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us.    Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or    that we currently deem insignificant may also impair our    business operations. The occurrence of any of the following    risks could harm our business, financial condition or results of    operations. Increases    in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels and utilities    could cause costs to increase.     Commodities, such as flour, sweeteners, shortening and eggs,    which are used in our bakery products, are subject to price    fluctuations. Any substantial increase in the prices of raw    materials may have an adverse impact on our profitability.    Agricultural commodity prices reached all time high levels    during 2007. The combination of prolonged global economic    development in countries such as China and India and government    mandated usage of agricultural products for the production of    fuels like ethanol and biodiesel have significantly increased    the demand for agricultural commodities. Production levels have    not been able to increase as fast as demand has developed and    commodity markets are rationing the available supply through    substantially higher prices. In addition, we are dependent upon    natural gas and propane for firing ovens. The independent    distributors and third party shipping companies we use are    dependent upon gasoline and diesel as fuel for distribution    vehicles. Substantial future increases in prices for, or    shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverse effect    on our operations and financial results. The company cannot    guarantee that it can cover these cost increases through future    pricing actions. Additionally, as a result of these pricing    actions consumers could move from the purchase of high margin    branded products to lower margin store brands. We rely    on a few large customers for a significant portion of our sales    and the loss of one of our large customers could adversely    affect our financial condition and results of    operations.     We have several large customers that account for a significant    portion of our sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 43.0%    of our sales during fiscal 2007. Our largest customer,    Wal-Mart/Sams Club, accounted for 19.9% of our sales    during this period. The loss of one of our large customers could    adversely affect our results of operations. These customers do    not typically enter into long-term sales contracts and make    purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product    quality, consumer demand and customer service performance.

If our sales to one or more of    these customers are reduced, this reduction may adversely affect    our business. Consolidation    in the retail and foodservice industries could affect our sales    and profitability.     As the consolidation trend among our customers continues and our    customers, including mass merchandisers, grow larger and become    more sophisticated, they may demand lower pricing, increased    promotional programs or special packaging from product    suppliers. Meeting these demands may adversely affect our    margins. If we are not selected by our customers for most of our    products or if we fail to effectively respond to their demands,    our sales and profitability could be adversely affected. Our large    customers may impose requirements on us that may adversely    affect our results of operations.     From time to time, our large customers, including    Wal-Mart/Sams Club, may re-evaluate or refine their    business practices and impose new or revised requirements upon    their suppliers, including us. These business demands may relate    to inventory practices, logistics or other aspects of the    customer-supplier relationship.    10Table of Contents    Compliance with requirements imposed by significant customers    may be costly and may have an adverse effect on our results of    operations.

Generally accepted accounting principles require the company to    record compensation expense for these rights based on changes in    the companys stock price between the grant date and an    estimated fair value of the rights at the balance sheet date    that is presented using an option pricing model. The company    uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model. If the price    of our common stock increases more than we project during the    measurement period, the company may have to recognize greater    than expected compensation expense, which could negatively    affect our results of operations. We rely    on the value of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and    enhancing the awareness of our brands are increasing, which    could have an adverse impact on our revenues and    profitability.     We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names.

Failure to comply with, or violations of, the regulatory    requirements of one or more of these agencies can result in a    variety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsory    withdrawal of products from store shelves. In addition, future    regulation by these agencies, the military action in Iraq and    the continuing threat of terrorist attacks, could increase our    commodity and service costs and have material adverse effect on    our results of operations and financial condition. Any    business disruption due to political instability, armed    hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could    adversely impact our financial performance.     If terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability or    natural disasters occur in the U.S. or other locations,    such events may disrupt manufacturing, labor and other aspects    of our business. In the event of such incidents, our business    and financial performance could be adversely affected. Our    articles of incorporation, bylaws, and shareholder rights plan    and Georgia law may inhibit a change in control that you may    favor.     Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, shareholder rights    plan and Georgia law contain provisions that may delay, deter or    inhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board of    directors. This could occur even if our shareholders are offered    an attractive value for their shares or if a substantial number    or even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover is    in their best interest. These provisions are intended to    encourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiate    with and obtain the approval of our board of directors in    connection with the transaction. Provisions in our    organizational documents that could delay, deter or inhibit a    future acquisition include the following:           a classified board of directors;           the requirement that our shareholders may only remove directors    for cause;           specified requirements for calling special meetings of    shareholders; and           the ability of the board of directors to consider the interests    of various constituencies, including our employees, clients and    creditors and the local community.     Our articles of incorporation also permit the board of directors    to issue shares of preferred stock with such designations,    powers, preferences and rights as it determines, without any    further vote or action by our shareholders. In addition, we have    in place a shareholders rights plan that will trigger a    dilutive issuance of common stock upon substantial purchases of    our common stock by a third party that are not approved by the    board of directors.    12Table of Contents "

     You should carefully consider the risks described below,together with all of the other information included in thisreport, in considering our business and prospects. The risks anduncertainties described below9Table of Contentsare not the only ones facing us. Additional risks anduncertainties not presently known to us or that we currentlydeem insignificant may also impair our business operations. Theoccurrence of any of the following risks could harm ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.Competition could adversely impact revenues and    profitability.     The United States bakery industry is highly competitive.Competition is based on product availability, product quality,price, effective promotions and the ability to target changingconsumer preferences. We experience price pressure from time totime as a result of our competitors promotional efforts.Increased competition could result in reduced sales, margins,profits and market share.Our ability to execute our business strategy could affect our    business.     We employ various strategies to be one of the nationsleading producers and marketers of bakery products available tocustomers through multiple channels of distribution. If we areunsuccessful in implementing or executing one or more of thesestrategies, our business could be adversely affected.We rely on a few large customers for a significant portion of    our sales and the loss of one of our large customers could    adversely affect our financial condition and results of    operations.     We have several large customers that account for a significantportion of our sales. Our top ten customers accounted for 40.6%of our sales during fiscal 2005. Our largest customer, Wal-Mart/Sams Club, accounted for 17.3% of our sales during thisperiod. The loss of one of our large customers could adverselyaffect our results of operations. These customers do nottypically enter into long-term contracts and make purchasedecisions based on a combination of price, product quality,consumer demand and customer service performance. They may inthe future use more of their shelf space, including spacecurrently used for our products, for private label products. Ifour sales to one or more of these customers are reduced, thisreduction may adversely affect our business. OnFebruary 21, 2005, Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., our secondlargest customer during fiscal 2005, representing 3.9% of oursales, filed voluntary petitions for reorganization underchapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Thecompany is continuing to serve this customer, and thus far thereorganization has not had a material effect on our results ofoperations, financial condition or cash flows.Consolidation in the retail and foodservice industries could    affect our sales and profitability.     As the consolidation trend among our customers continues and ourcustomers, including mass merchandisers, grow larger and becomemore sophisticated, they may demand lower pricing, increasedpromotional programs or special packaging from productsuppliers. Meeting these demands may adversely affect ourmargins. If we are not selected by our customers for most of ourproducts or if we fail to effectively respond to their demands,our sales and profitability could be adversely affected.Our large customers may impose requirements on us that may    adversely affect our results of operations.     From time to time, our large customers, includingWal-Mart/Sams Club, may re-evaluate or refine theirbusiness practices and impose new or revised requirements upontheir suppliers, including us. These business demands may relateto inventory practices, logistics or other aspects of thecustomer-supplier relationship. Compliance with requirementsimposed by significant customers may be costly and may have anadverse effect on our results of operations. However, if we failto meet a significant customers demands, we could losethat customers business, which could adversely affect ourresults of operations.Increases in costs and/or shortages of raw materials, fuels    and utilities could cause costs to increase.     Commodities, such as flour, sugar, cocoa and eggs, which areused in our bakery products, are subject to price fluctuations.Any substantial increase in the prices of raw materials may havean adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, we aredependent upon natural gas and propane for firing ovens. Theindependent distributors and third party shipping companies weuse are dependent upon gasoline and diesel as fuel for10Table of Contentsdistribution vehicles. Substantial future increases in pricesfor, or shortages of, these fuels could have a material adverseeffect on our operations and financial results.Employee relations and increases in employee and    employee-related costs could have adverse effects on our    profitability.     Pension, health care and workers compensation costs havebeen increasing and will likely continue to increase. Anysubstantial increase in pension, health care or workerscompensation costs may have an adverse impact on ourprofitability. The company records pension costs and theliabilities related to its benefit plans based on actuarialvaluations, which include key assumptions determined bymanagement. Material changes in pension costs may occur in thefuture due to changes in these assumptions. Future annualamounts could be impacted by various factors, such as changes inthe number of plan participants, changes in the discount rate,changes in the expected long-term rate of return, changes in thelevel of contributions to the plan and other factors. There havebeen no new participants in the companys defined benefitplan since December 31, 1998. During the third quarter offiscal 2005, the company announced the curtailment of one of itsdefined benefit pension plans effective January 1, 2006,the beginning of the companys fiscal year 2006.We have risks related to our pension plans, which could    impact the companys liquidity.     The company has trusteed, noncontributory defined pension planscovering certain employees maintained under theU.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974(ERISA). The funding obligations for our pensionplans are impacted by the performance of the financial markets,including the performance of our common stock, which comprisesapproximately 13.2% of the assets (as of December 31, 2005)of our pension plans.     If the financial markets do not provide the long-term returnsthat are expected, the likelihood of our being required to makecontributions will increase. The equity markets can be, andrecently have been, very volatile, and therefore our estimate offuture contribution requirements can change dramatically inrelatively short periods of time. Similarly, changes in interestrates can impact our contribution requirements. In alow-interest-rate environment, the likelihood of requiredcontributions in the future increases.A disruption in the operation of our direct store    distribution system could negatively affect our results of    operations and financial condition.     We believe that our DSD distribution system is a significantcompetitive advantage for us. A material negative change in ourrelations with the independent distributors, an adverse rulingby regulatory or governmental bodies regarding our independentdistributorship program or an adverse judgment against thecompany for actions taken by the independent distributors couldmaterially affect our results of operation and financialcondition.Compensation costs associated with our stock appreciation    rights plan could have adverse effects on our results of    operations.     The company has previously awarded stock appreciation rights tokey employees throughout the company. Generally acceptedaccounting principles require the company to record compensationexpense for these rights based on changes in the companysstock price between the grant date and the balance sheet datethat is presented. If the price of our common stock increasesmore than we project during the measurement period, the companymay have to recognize greater than expected compensationexpense, which could negatively affect our results of operations.We rely on the value of our brands, and the costs of    maintaining and enhancing the awareness of our brands are    increasing, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues    and profitability.     We rely on the success of our well-recognized brand names. Weintend to maintain our strong brand recognition by continuing todevote resources to advertising, marketing and other brandbuilding efforts. If we11Table of Contentsare not able to successfully maintain our brand recognition, ourrevenues and profitability could be adversely affected.Inability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences may    result in decreased demand for products, which could have an    adverse impact on our future growth and operating results.     Our success depends in part on our ability to respond to currentmarket trends and to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits ofconsumers. Consumer preferences change, and our failure toanticipate, identify or react to these changes could result inreduced demand for our products, which could in turn cause ouroperating results to suffer.Future product recalls or safety concerns could adversely    impact our results of operations.     We may be required to recall certain of our products should theybe mislabeled, contaminated or damaged. We also may becomeinvolved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged thatthe consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness ordeath. A product recall or an adverse result in any suchlitigation could have a material adverse effect on our operatingand financial results. We also could be adversely affected ifconsumers in our principal markets lose confidence in the safetyand quality of our products.Government regulation could adversely impact our results of    operations and financial condition.     As a producer and marketer of food items, we are subject toregulation by various federal, state and local governmententities and agencies with respect to production processes,product quality, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution.Failure to comply with, or violations of, the regulatoryrequirements of one or more of these agencies can result in avariety of sanctions, including monetary fines or compulsorywithdrawal of products from store shelves. In addition, futureregulation by these agencies, the military action in Iraq andthe continuing threat of terrorist attacks, could increase ourcommodity and service costs and have material adverse effect onour results of operations and financial condition.Any business disruption due to political instability, armed    hostilities, incidents of terrorism or natural disasters could    adversely impact our financial performance.     If terrorist activity, armed conflict, political instability ornatural disasters occur in the U.S. or other locations,such events may disrupt manufacturing, labor and other aspectsof our business. In the event of such incidents, our businessand financial performance could be adversely affected.Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and shareholder rights    plan and Georgia law may inhibit a change in control that you    may favor.     Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, shareholder rightsplan and Georgia law contain provisions that may delay, deter orinhibit a future acquisition of us not approved by our board ofdirectors. This could occur even if our shareholders are offeredan attractive value for their shares or if a substantial numberor even a majority of our shareholders believe the takeover isin their best interest. These provisions are intended toencourage any person interested in acquiring us to negotiatewith and obtain the approval of our board of directors inconnection with the transaction.
