2,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2023-08-23,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSVarious risks and uncertainties could affect our business. In addition to the information contained elsewhere in this report and other filings that we make with the SEC, the risk factors described below could have a material impact on 11Table of Contentsour business, financial condition, results of operation, cash flows or the trading price of our common stock. It is not possible to identify all risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations. Strategic and Operational RisksIf we are unable to successfully design and execute a business strategy plan, our gross sales and profitability may be adversely affected. Our ability to increase revenues and profitability is dependent on designing and executing effective business strategies. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees’ ability to:•Increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options desired by our guests;•Evolve our marketing and branding strategies in order to appeal to guests;•Innovate and implement technology initiatives that provide a unique digital guest experience;•Identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reimaging existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new restaurant equipment;•Grow and expand operations, including identifying available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants, or making strategic acquisitions; and•Improve the speed and quality of our service.Changes in consumer preferences may decrease demand for food at our restaurants.Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The food service industry as a whole depends on consumer preferences at the local, regional, national and international levels. New information or changes in dietary, nutritional or health insurance guidelines, whether issued by government agencies, academic studies, advocacy organizations or similar groups, may cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our Company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.Food safety incidents at our restaurants or in our industry or supply chain may adversely affect customer perception of our brands or industry and result in declines in sales and profits. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues at one of our restaurants or our franchisees’ restaurants could irreparably damage our brand reputations and result in declines in guest traffic and sales at our restaurants. A food safety incident may subject us to regulatory actions and litigation, including criminal investigations, and we may be required to incur significant legal costs and other liabilities. Food safety incidents may occur in our supply chain and be out of our control. Health concerns or outbreaks of disease in a food product could also reduce demand for particular menu offerings. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry in general and adversely affect our sales or cause us to incur additional costs to implement food safety protocols beyond industry standards. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may affect public perception of the brand. 12Table of ContentsMulti-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, customer complaints, litigation, illness or health concerns or other issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants, regardless of whether such events have a factual basis. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili’s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili’s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili’s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of social media and the internet. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.Additionally, consumers’ ability to immediately post opinions on social media platforms to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted, may be adverse to our interests and may harm our performance, prospects or business, regardless of the information’s accuracy. The use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.We face risks related to our ability to continue to grow sales through delivery orders and digital commerce.Part of our strategy for growth is dependent on increased sales from guests that want to enjoy our food off premises. Customers are increasingly using websites and applications, including both our internally developed brand websites and third-party delivery aggregators, to place and pay for their orders. As we become increasingly reliant on digital ordering and payment as a sales channel, our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement, execute or maintain our consumer-facing digital initiatives, such as curbside pick-up, brand websites, and application based ordering. These digital ordering and payment platforms also could be damaged or interrupted by power loss, technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, other forms of sabotage, inclement weather or natural disasters. The digital ordering platforms we rely on could experience interruptions, which could limit or delay customers’ ability to order through such platforms or make customers less inclined to return to such platforms. We currently rely on third-party delivery providers for our off premise delivery (other than Maggiano’s catering). We rely on such third-party providers for ordering and payment platforms that receive guest orders and that send orders directly to our point-of-sale system. These platforms, as well as our own brand websites, could be damaged or interrupted by technological failures, cyber-attacks or other factors, which may adversely impact our sales through these channels.Delivery providers generally fulfill delivery orders through drivers that are independent contractors. These drivers may make errors, fail to make timely deliveries, damage our food or poorly represent our brands, which may lead to customer disappointment, reputational harm and unmet sales expectations. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if there is a shortage of drivers that are willing and available to make deliveries from our restaurants. If the third-party aggregators that we utilize for delivery cease or curtail their operations, fail to maintain sufficient labor force to satisfy demand, materially change fees, access or visibility to our products or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our business may be negatively impacted.Loss of key management personnel could hurt our business and limit our ability to operate and grow successfully. Our success depends, to a significant extent, on our leadership team and other key management personnel. These personnel serve to maintain a corporate vision for our Company, execute our business strategy, and maintain consistency in the operating standards of our restaurants. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable key management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer.Failure to recruit, train and retain high-quality restaurant management and team members may result in lower guest satisfaction and lower sales and profitability. Our restaurant-level management and team members are largely responsible for the quality of our service. Our guests may be dissatisfied and our sales may decline if we fail to recruit, train and retain managers and team members that effectively implement our business strategy and provide high quality guest service. There is active 13Table of Contentscompetition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. We are experiencing and may continue to experience challenges in recruiting and retaining team members in various locations as we are experiencing an increasingly tight and competitive labor market. These challenges may continue to result in higher labor costs (such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wages to attract and retain team members), increased turnover and a shortage of adequate management personnel and hourly team members required for operations and for future growth, which can lead to lower guest satisfaction and decreased profitability. Our results can be adversely affected by events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, climate change, pandemics or other catastrophic events.Adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, climate change or catastrophic events, such as terrorist acts, can adversely impact restaurant sales. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and severe adverse weather conditions, climate change and health pandemics, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, can keep customers in the affected area from dining out, adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, cause damage to or closure of restaurants and result in lost opportunities for our restaurants. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.The large number of Company-owned restaurants concentrated in Texas, Florida and California makes us susceptible to changes in economic and other trends in those regions. A high concentration of our Company-owned restaurants are located in Texas, Florida and California comprising 18.7%, 11.6% and 9.5%, respectively, as of June 28, 2023. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states. Negative publicity, local economic conditions, health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19), local strikes, energy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters in regions where our restaurants are highly concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. The operational success of our franchise system is important to our business and future international growth. A significant percentage of system-wide restaurants are owned and operated by our franchisees. Our franchise related revenue is not material to our total revenues; however, franchise agreements are designed to require our franchisees to maintain brand consistency and the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day oversight of these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control. Our international restaurants are substantially all franchised and our ability to grow internationally is largely dependent on the success of our franchise partners in developing and maintaining new restaurants. Our reputation and financial results may be negatively impacted by: franchisee defaults in their obligations to us; limitations on our ability to enforce franchise obligations due to bankruptcy proceedings or differences in legal remedies in international markets; franchisee failures to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; franchisee failures to meet obligations to pay employees; and franchisees’ failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements.Additionally, our international franchisees are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees, and royalties paid to us may decrease if their businesses are negatively impacted. These risks include:•Difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to domestic operations;•Changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;•Challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and•Differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, social and political conditions.14Table of ContentsFailure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business. We regard our Chili’s® and Maggiano’s® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other entities. Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs. Some business processes are or may in the future be outsourced to third parties. Such processes include certain information technology processes, gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results and may damage our reputation.Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their environmental, social, and governance practices. Changing consumer preferences may result in increased demands regarding our products and supply chain and their respective environmental and social impact, including on sustainability. These demands could require additional transparency, due diligence, and reporting and could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with such demands. We may also determine that certain changes are required in anticipation of further evolution of consumer preferences and demands. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may also result in investors reconsidering their investment decisions as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Further, concern over climate change and other environmental sustainability matters, has and may in the future result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions regulations, alternative energy policies, and sustainability initiatives. If we fail to achieve any goals, targets, or objectives we may set with respect to ESG matters, if we do not meet or comply with new regulations or evolving consumer, investor, industry, or stakeholder expectations and standards, including those related to reporting, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG matters, we may face legal or regulatory actions, the imposition of fines, penalties, or other sanctions, adverse publicity, and decreased demand from consumers, or the price of our common shares could decline, any of which could materially harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksCompetition may adversely affect our operations and financial results. The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, convenience, and type and quality of food. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional 15Table of Contentsrestaurant chains. The casual dining segment of the restaurant industry has not seen significant growth in customer traffic in recent years. If these trends continue, our ability to grow customer traffic at our restaurants (including through off-premise) will depend on our ability to increase our market share within the casual dining segment. We also face competition from quick service and fast casual restaurants; the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services; and meal kit and food delivery providers. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict. If we are unable to compete effectively, our gross sales, guest traffic and profitability may decline.Global and domestic economic conditions negatively impact consumer discretionary spending and our business operations and could have a material negative effect on our financial performance. The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, which is negatively affected by global and domestic economic conditions, such as: fluctuations in disposable income and changes in consumer confidence, the price of gasoline, slow or negative growth, unemployment, credit conditions and availability, volatility in financial markets, inflationary pressures, weakness in the housing market, tariffs and trade barriers, wars or conflict in certain regions, pandemics or public health concerns, and changes in government and central bank monetary policies. When economic conditions negatively affect consumer spending, discretionary spending for restaurant visits will be challenged, our guest traffic may deteriorate and the average amount guests spend in our restaurants may be reduced. This will negatively impact our revenues and also result in lower royalties collected, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. This could result in further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures.We have been adversely impacted by, and may continue to be adversely impacted by, ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the U.S. and other regions of the world where our franchisees operate, including recent labor, commodity, transportation and other inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, military conflict and impacts arising from governmental restrictions implemented in certain regions to mitigate against the pandemic.General economic conditions, including inflation and fluctuations in energy costs, may continue to increase our operating expenses. We have in the past, and are currently experiencing the impacts of economic conditions, including inflation and fluctuations in utility and energy costs. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. Fluctuations and increases in utility and energy costs have also increased our operating expenses on regional and national levels, including through suppliers putting pressure on margins by passing on higher prices for petroleum-based fuels. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, or by implementing alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover some of the increases in operating expenses due to economic conditions, including inflation, in this manner.Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues. Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather; natural disasters such as floods, droughts and hurricanes; health epidemics or pandemics; shortages in the availability of truck drivers; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; trade barriers; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; animal disease outbreaks; or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs or reduce revenues and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.16Table of ContentsInformation and Technology Related RisksWe are exposed to risks related to cyber security and protection of confidential information, and failure to protect the integrity and security of payment card or individually identifiable information of our guests and teammates or confidential and proprietary information of the Company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues, increased costs and litigation. Our technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our guests and team members, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, and a significant portion of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. If our technology systems, or those of third-party services providers we rely upon, are compromised as a result of a cyber-attack (including whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or social engineering) or other external or internal method, it could result in an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. The cyber risks we face range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to attacks that target us due to the confidential consumer information we obtain through our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions. Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us, as well as the imposition of penalties. These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. To conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national borders, and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. The use and disclosure of such information is regulated and enforced at the federal, state and international levels, and these laws, rules and regulations are subject to change.As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur significant additional costs in technology, third-party services and personnel to maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber-attacks. For example, the Company experienced a cyber security incident at some Chili’s locations in fiscal 2018. As with many public companies, our defenses are under attack regularly. There have been and will be minor intrusions from time-to-time. As a result of the incident, we have taken certain additional preventative measures to reduce cyber risks. However, we cannot provide assurance that our security frameworks and measures will be successful in preventing future significant cyber-attacks or data loss. We are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business. We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.17Table of ContentsFinancial RisksDowngrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Credit rating agencies have, and in the future may, change their credit rating for us, among other things, based on the performance of our business, our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding public debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be further lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things:•Increase our cost of borrowing;•Limit our ability to access capital;•Result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur, including restrictions on our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;•Require us to provide collateral for any future borrowings; and •Adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities.These ratings and our current credit condition affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital. Negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt agreement. Our credit ratings could be further lowered, or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, a weakening of our financial condition, including any further increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds, could result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook, or could otherwise increase our cost of borrowing.Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. We perform our annual goodwill impairment tests in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and no indicators of impairment were identified. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified through the end of fiscal 2023. This assessment is predicated on our ability to continue to operate dining and banquet rooms and generate off-premise sales at our restaurants. We will continue to monitor and evaluate our results and evaluate the likelihood of any potential impairment charges at our reporting units.It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for the recognition of impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.Changes to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets. We make certain estimates and projections with respect to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. For example, in fiscal 2023, we recognized 18Table of Contents$12.0 million of long-lived asset and lease asset impairment charges as a result of decreased cash flows, and it is possible that we may incur similar charges in greater amounts in the future. Refer to Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The projection of future cash flows used in the analyses requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.Legal and Regulatory RisksLitigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance. We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business or out of special circumstances. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food-borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the food service industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. Our franchise activity also creates a risk of us being named as a joint employer of workers of franchisees for alleged violations of labor and wage laws. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expenses, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Publicly traded companies also may become the target of shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and legal fees and divert management’s and our Board of Directors’ attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.From time to time we may implement measures that make it more difficult for an activist investor or potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire the Company through a merger or similar transaction. These measures may discourage investment in our common stock and may delay or discourage acquisitions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares over the then-current market price.Employment and labor laws and regulations may increase the cost of labor for our restaurants. We are subject to various federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations that govern employment and labor matters, including, employment discrimination, minimum wages, work scheduling, overtime, tip credits, tax reporting, working conditions, safety standards, employment of minors, family leave and immigration status. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity or litigation. We have been and are under investigation for compliance periodically, and we have been and will be fined for alleged violations of these regulations. Some states and localities have, and many others are contemplating, increases to their minimum wage and tip credit wage, and such increases can have a significant impact on our labor costs. In addition, new employment or labor laws may mandate additional benefits for employees or impose additional obligations that may adversely impact the costs of labor, the availability of labor and our business operations. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher 19Table of Contentsminimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can offset all of the costs associated with compliance.Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and which increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings. Among other laws and regulations, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the design and operation of facilities, minimum wage, licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies, nutritional content and menu labeling, including the Affordable Care Act, which requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of these laws.We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the United States and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance.We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations which govern the offer and sale of franchises and which may supersede the terms of franchise agreements between us and our franchisees. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and our franchisees. Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state, local, and international authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities inside and outside of the United States in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.20Table of ContentsFailure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.We are subject to the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our processes for designing and implementing effective internal controls involve continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business as well as in the economic and regulatory environments. As a result, we expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take as part of this effort will be sufficient to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in consolidated financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, or result in regulatory scrutiny, penalties or shareholder litigation, all of which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.General Risk Factors
Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance. Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements, include, without limitation, changes in financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates); increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events; changes in consumer behaviors; changes in demographic trends; labor shortages and availability of employees; union organization; strikes; wars or conflicts in certain regions; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; weather and climate change (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms); inadequate insurance coverage; and limitations imposed by our credit agreements"
11,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2022-08-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe caution you that our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The risk factors listed below could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, our other filings with the SEC, our news releases, or our other verbal or written communications. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruptions on our business and operations and in the risk factors below, additional risks and uncertainties that are currently not known or believed by us to be immaterial may also have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In any such event, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.Strategic and Operational RisksIf we are unable to successfully design and execute a business strategy plan, our gross sales and profitability may be adversely affected. Our ability to increase revenues and profitability is dependent on designing and executing effective business strategies. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees’ ability to:•Increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options desired by our guests;•Evolve our marketing and branding strategies in order to appeal to guests;•Innovate and implement technology initiatives that provide a unique digital guest experience;•Identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reimaging existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new restaurant equipment;•Grow and expand operations, including identifying available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants, or making strategic acquisitions; and•Improve the speed and quality of our service.Changes in consumer preferences may decrease demand for food at our restaurants.Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The food service industry as a whole depends on consumer preferences at the local, regional, national and international levels. New information or changes in dietary, nutritional or health insurance guidelines, whether issued by government agencies, academic studies, advocacy organizations or similar groups, may cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our Company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.12Table of ContentsFood safety incidents at our restaurants or in our industry or supply chain may adversely affect customer perception of our brands or industry and result in declines in sales and profits. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues at one of our restaurants or our franchisees’ restaurants could irreparably damage our brand reputations and result in declines in guest traffic and sales at our restaurants. A food safety incident may subject us to regulatory actions and litigation, including criminal investigations, and we may be required to incur significant legal costs and other liabilities. Food safety incidents may occur in our supply chain and be out of our control. Health concerns or outbreaks of disease in a food product could also reduce demand for particular menu offerings. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry in general and adversely affect our sales or cause us to incur additional costs to implement food safety protocols beyond industry standards. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand. Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, customer complaints, litigation, illness or health concerns or other issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants, regardless of whether such events have a factual basis. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili’s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili’s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili’s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of the internet. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.Additionally, consumers’ ability to immediately post opinions on social media platforms to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted, may be adverse to our interests and may harm our performance, prospects or business, regardless of the information’s accuracy. The use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.We face risks related to our ability to continue to grow sales through delivery orders and digital commerce.Part of our strategy for growth is dependent on increased sales from guests that want to enjoy our food off premises. Customers are increasingly using websites and applications, including both our internally developed brand websites and third-party delivery aggregators, to place and pay for their orders. As we become increasingly reliant on digital ordering and payment as a sales channel, our business could be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully implement, execute or maintain our consumer-facing digital initiatives, such as curbside pick-up, brand websites, and application based ordering. These digital ordering and payment platforms also could be damaged or interrupted by power loss, technological failures, user errors, cyber-attacks, other forms of sabotage, inclement weather or natural disasters. The digital ordering platforms we rely on could experience interruptions, which could limit or delay customers’ ability to order through such platforms or make customers less inclined to return to such platforms. We currently rely on third-party delivery providers for our off premise delivery (other than Maggiano’s catering). We rely on such third-party providers for ordering and payment platforms that receive guest orders and that send orders directly to our point-of-sale system. These platforms, as well as our own brand websites, could be damaged or interrupted by technological failures, cyber-attacks or other factors, which may adversely impact our sales through these channels.Delivery providers generally fulfill delivery orders through drivers that are independent contractors. These drivers may make errors, fail to make timely deliveries, damage our food or poorly represent our brands, which may lead to customer disappointment, reputational harm and unmet sales expectations. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if there is a shortage of drivers that are willing and available to make deliveries from our restaurants. If the third-party aggregators that we utilize for delivery cease or curtail their operations, fail to maintain sufficient labor 13Table of Contentsforce to satisfy demand, materially change fees, access or visibility to our products or give greater priority or promotions on their platforms to our competitors, our business may be negatively impacted.Loss of key management personnel could hurt our business and limit our ability to operate and grow successfully. Our success depends, to a significant extent, on our leadership team and other key management personnel. These personnel serve to maintain a corporate vision for our Company, execute our business strategy, and maintain consistency in the operating standards of our restaurants. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable key management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer.Failure to recruit, train and retain high-quality restaurant management and team members may result in lower guest satisfaction and lower sales and profitability. Our restaurant-level management and team members are largely responsible for the quality of our service. Our guests may be dissatisfied and our sales may decline if we fail to recruit, train and retain managers and team members that effectively implement our business strategy and provide high quality guest service. There is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. We are experiencing and may continue to experience challenges in recruiting and retaining team members in various locations as we are experiencing an increasingly tight and competitive labor market. These challenges may continue to result in higher labor costs (such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wages to attract and retain team members), increased turnover and a shortage of adequate management personnel and hourly team members required for operations and for future growth, which can lead to lower guest satisfaction and decreased profitability. Our results can be adversely affected by events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, climate change, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other catastrophic events.Adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, climate change or catastrophic events, such as terrorist acts, can adversely impact restaurant sales. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and severe adverse weather conditions, climate change and health pandemics (such as COVID-19) whether occurring in the United States or abroad, can keep customers in the affected area from dining out, adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, cause damage to or closure of restaurants and result in lost opportunities for our restaurants. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.The large number of Company-owned restaurants concentrated in Texas, Florida and California makes us susceptible to changes in economic and other trends in those regions. A high concentration of our Company-owned restaurants are located in Texas, Florida and California comprising 18.5%, 11.6% and 9.5%, respectively, as of June 29, 2022. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states. Negative publicity, local economic conditions, health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19), local strikes, energy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters in regions where our restaurants are highly concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For example, declines in oil prices may increase levels of unemployment and cause other economic pressures that result in lower sales and profits at our restaurants in oil market regions of Texas and surrounding areas.The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth. We have a significant percentage of system-wide restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to require our franchisees to maintain brand consistency, the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day oversight of these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control. Our reputation and financial results may be negatively impacted by: franchisee defaults in their obligations to us; limitations on our ability to enforce franchise obligations due to bankruptcy proceedings or differences in legal remedies in international markets; franchisee failures to 14Table of Contentsparticipate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; franchisee failures to meet obligations to pay employees; and franchisees’ failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements.Additionally, our international franchisees are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees, and royalties paid to us may decrease if their businesses are negatively impacted. These risks include:•Difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to domestic operations;•Changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;•Challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and•Differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, social and political conditions.Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business. We regard our Chili’s® and Maggiano’s® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other entities. Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs. Some business processes are or may in the future be outsourced to third parties. Such processes include certain information technology processes, gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results and may damage our reputation.Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their environmental, social, and governance practices. Changing consumer preferences may result in increased demands regarding our products and supply chain and their respective environmental and social impact, including on sustainability. These demands could require additional transparency, due diligence, and reporting and could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with such demands. We may also determine that certain changes are required in anticipation of further evolution of consumer preferences and demands. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may also result in investors reconsidering their investment decisions as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. Further, concern over climate change and other environmental sustainability matters, has and may in the future result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions regulations, alternative energy policies, and sustainability 15Table of Contentsinitiatives. If we fail to achieve any goals, targets, or objectives we may set with respect to ESG matters, if we do not meet or comply with new regulations or evolving consumer, investor, industry, or stakeholder expectations and standards, including those related to reporting, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG matters, we may face legal or regulatory actions, the imposition of fines, penalties, or other sanctions, adverse publicity, and decreased demand from consumers, or the price of our common shares could decline, any of which could materially harm our reputation or have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksCompetition may adversely affect our operations and financial results. The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, convenience, and type and quality of food. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains. The casual dining segment of the restaurant industry has not seen significant growth in customer traffic in recent years and saw a significant decrease as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, from which a full recovery has not yet been made. If these trends continue, our ability to grow customer traffic at our restaurants (including through off-premise) will depend on our ability to increase our market share within the casual dining segment. We also face competition from quick service and fast casual restaurants; the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services; and meal kit and food delivery providers. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict. If we are unable to compete effectively, our gross sales, guest traffic and profitability may decline.Global and domestic economic conditions negatively impact consumer discretionary spending and our business operations and could have a material negative effect on our financial performance. The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, which is negatively affected by global and domestic economic conditions, such as: fluctuations in disposable income and changes in consumer confidence, the price of gasoline, slow or negative growth, unemployment, credit conditions and availability, volatility in financial markets, inflationary pressures, weakness in the housing market, tariffs and trade barriers, pandemics or public health concerns, and changes in government and central bank monetary policies. When economic conditions negatively affect consumer spending, discretionary spending for restaurant visits will be challenged, our guest traffic may deteriorate and the average amount guests spend in our restaurants may be reduced. This will negatively impact our revenues and also result in lower royalties collected, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. This could result in further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures.We have been adversely impacted by, and may continue to be adversely impacted by, ongoing macroeconomic challenges in the U.S. and other regions of the world where our franchisees operate arising in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, including recent labor, commodity, transportation and other inflationary pressures, supply chain disruptions, military conflict and impacts arising from governmental restrictions implemented in certain regions to mitigate against the pandemic.General economic conditions, including inflation and fluctuations in energy costs, may continue to increase our operating expenses. We have in the past, and are currently experiencing the impacts of economic conditions, including inflation and fluctuations in utility and energy costs. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. Fluctuations and increases in utility and energy costs have also increased our operating expenses on regional and national levels, including through suppliers putting pressure on margins by passing on higher prices for petroleum-based fuels. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, or by implementing alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover some of the increases in operating expenses due to economic conditions, including inflation, in this manner.16Table of ContentsShortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues. Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather; natural disasters such as floods, droughts and hurricanes; health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19); shortages in the availability of truck drivers; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; trade barriers; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; animal disease outbreaks; or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs or reduce revenues and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.Information and Technology Related RisksWe are exposed to risks related to cyber security and protection of confidential information, and failure to protect the integrity and security of payment card or individually identifiable information of our guests and teammates or confidential and proprietary information of the Company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues, increased costs and litigation. Our technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our guests and team members, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, and a significant portion of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. If our technology systems, or those of third-party services providers we rely upon, are compromised as a result of a cyber-attack (including whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or social engineering) or other external or internal method, it could result in an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. The cyber risks we face range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to attacks that target us due to the confidential consumer information we obtain through our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions. Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us, as well as the imposition of penalties. These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. To conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national borders, and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. The use and disclosure of such information is regulated and enforced at the federal, state and international levels, and these laws, rules and regulations are subject to change.As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur significant additional costs in technology, third-party services and personnel to maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber-attacks. For example, the Company experienced a cyber security incident at some Chili’s locations in fiscal 2018. As a result of the incident, we have taken certain additional preventative measures to reduce cyber risks. However, we cannot provide assurance that our security frameworks and measures will be successful in preventing future cyber-attacks or data loss. We are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business. We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in 17Table of Contentsplace to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.Financial RisksDowngrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Credit rating agencies have, and in the future may, change their credit rating for us, among other things, based on the performance of our business, our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding public debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be further lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things:•Increase our cost of borrowing;•Limit our ability to access capital;•Result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur, including restrictions on our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;•Require us to provide collateral for any future borrowings; and •Adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities.These ratings and our current credit condition affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital. Negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt agreement. Our credit ratings could be further lowered, or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, a weakening of our financial condition, including any further increase in our leverage or decrease in our profitability or cash flows, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds, could result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook, or could otherwise increase our cost of borrowing.Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. We perform our annual goodwill impairment tests in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 and no indicators of impairment were identified. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified through the end of fiscal 2022. This assessment is predicated on our ability to continue to operate dining and banquet rooms and generate off-premise sales at our restaurants. Management’s judgment about the short and long term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could change as additional facts become known and therefore affect these conclusions. We will continue to monitor and evaluate our results and evaluate the likelihood of any potential impairment charges at our reporting units.It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for the recognition of impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.18Table of ContentsChanges to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets. We make certain estimates and projections with respect to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. For example, in fiscal 2022, we recognized $8.3 million of long-lived asset and lease asset impairment charges as a result of decreased cash flows, and it is possible that we may incur similar charges in greater amounts in the future. Refer to Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The projection of future cash flows used in the analyses requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.Legal and Regulatory RisksLitigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance. We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business or out of special circumstances. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food-borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the food service industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. Our franchise activity also creates a risk of us being named as a joint employer of workers of franchisees for alleged violations of labor and wage laws. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expenses, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Publicly traded companies also may become the target of shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and legal fees and divert management’s and our Board of Directors’ attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.From time to time we may implement measures that make it more difficult for an activist investor or potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire the Company through a merger or similar transaction. These measures may discourage investment in our common stock and may delay or discourage acquisitions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares over the then-current market price.Employment and labor laws and regulations may increase the cost of labor for our restaurants. We are subject to various federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations that govern employment and labor matters, including, employment discrimination, minimum wages, work scheduling, overtime, tip credits, tax reporting, working conditions, safety standards, family leave and immigration status. Compliance 19Table of Contentswith these laws and regulations can be costly, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity or litigation. Some states and localities have, and many others are contemplating, increases to their minimum wage and tip credit wage, and such increases can have a significant impact on our labor costs. In addition, new employment or labor laws may mandate additional benefits for employees or impose additional obligations that may adversely impact the costs of labor, the availability of labor and our business operations. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can offset all of the costs associated with compliance.Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and which increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings. Among other laws and regulations, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the design and operation of facilities, minimum wage, licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies, nutritional content and menu labeling, including the Affordable Care Act, which requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of these laws.We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the United States and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance.We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations which govern the offer and sale of franchises and which may supersede the terms of franchise agreements between us and our franchisees. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and our franchisees. Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state, local, and international authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities inside and outside of the United 20Table of ContentsStates in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.We are subject to the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our processes for designing and implementing effective internal controls involve continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business as well as in the economic and regulatory environments. As a result, we expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take as part of this effort will be sufficient to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in consolidated financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, or result in regulatory scrutiny, penalties or shareholder litigation, all of which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.General Risk Factors
Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance. Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements, include, without limitation, changes in financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates); increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) or the prospects of these events; changes in consumer behaviors; changes in demographic trends; labor shortages and availability of employees; union organization; strikes; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; weather and climate change (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms); inadequate insurance coverage; and limitations imposed by our credit agreements"
15,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2021-08-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe caution you that our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky. The risk factors listed below could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, our other filings with the SEC, our news releases, or our other verbal or written communications. In addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting disruptions on our business and operations and in the risk factors below, additional risks and uncertainties that are currently not known or believed by us to be immaterial may also have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In any such event, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.Strategic and Operational RisksIf we are unable to successfully design and execute a business strategy plan, our gross sales and profitability may be adversely affected. Our ability to increase revenues and profitability is dependent on designing and executing effective business strategies. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees’ ability to:11Table of Contents•Increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options desired by our guests;•Evolve our marketing and branding strategies in order to appeal to guests;•Innovate and implement technology initiatives that provide a unique digital guest experience;•Identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reimaging existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new restaurant equipment;•Grow and expand operations, including identifying available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants, or making strategic acquisitions; and•Improve the speed and quality of our service.Changes in consumer preferences may decrease demand for food at our restaurants.Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The food service industry as a whole depends on consumer preferences at the local, regional, national and international levels. New information or changes in dietary, nutritional or health insurance guidelines, whether issued by government agencies, academic studies, advocacy organizations or similar groups, may cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our Company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.Food safety incidents at our restaurants or in our industry or supply chain may adversely affect customer perception of our brands or industry and result in declines in sales and profits. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues at one of our restaurants or our franchisees’ restaurants could irreparably damage our brand reputations and result in declines in guest traffic and sales at our restaurants. A food safety incident may subject us to regulatory actions and litigation, including criminal investigations, and we may be required to incur significant legal costs and other liabilities. Food safety incidents may occur in our supply chain and be out of our control. Health concerns or outbreaks of disease in a food product could also reduce demand for particular menu offerings. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry in general and adversely affect our sales or cause us to incur additional costs to implement food safety protocols beyond industry standards. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand. Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, customer complaints, litigation, illness or health concerns or other issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants, regardless of whether such events have a factual basis. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili’s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili’s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili’s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of the internet. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.Additionally, consumers’ ability to immediately post opinions on social media platforms to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted, may be adverse to our interests and may harm our performance, prospects or business, regardless of the information’s accuracy. The use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.12Table of ContentsOur ability to grow sales through delivery orders is uncertain.Part of our strategy for growth is dependent on increased sales from guests that want our food delivered to them. We currently rely on third-party delivery providers for the ordering and payment platforms that receive guest orders and that send orders directly to our point of sale system. These platforms could be damaged or interrupted by technological failures, cyber-attacks or other factors, which may adversely impact our sales through these channels.Delivery providers generally fulfills delivery orders through drivers that are independent contractors. These drivers may make errors, fail to make timely deliveries, damage our food or poorly represent our brands, which may lead to customer disappointment, reputational harm and unmet sales expectations. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if there is a shortage of drivers that are willing and available to make deliveries from our restaurants. We also incur additional costs associated with delivery orders, and it is possible that these orders could cannibalize more profitable in-restaurant visits or To-Go orders.Additionally, we have certain virtual brands that are only available through third-party platforms. We rely on DoorDash and Google Food Ordering to market and deliver certain offerings from our Chili’s and Maggiano’s kitchens. In addition to the delivery and technological risks discussed above, because certain offerings are only available through third-party platforms, if we have to transition to a different third-party delivery provider, our sales on such offerings would temporarily be diminished, and it is possible that we would not generate the same level of profitability with a different provider.Loss of key management personnel could hurt our business and limit our ability to operate and grow successfully. Our success depends, to a significant extent, on our leadership team and other key management personnel. These personnel serve to maintain a corporate vision for our Company, execute our business strategy, and maintain consistency in the operating standards of our restaurants. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable key management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer.Failure to recruit, train and retain high-quality restaurant management and team members may result in lower guest satisfaction and lower sales and profitability. Our restaurant-level management and team members are largely responsible for the quality of our service. Our guests may be dissatisfied and our sales may decline if we fail to recruit, train and retain managers and team members that effectively implement our business strategy and provide high quality guest service. There is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. We are experiencing and may continue to experience challenges in recruiting and retaining team members in various locations. These challenges may result in  higher labor costs, increased turnover and a shortage of adequate management personnel and hourly team members required for operations and for future growth, which can lead to lower guest satisfaction and decreased profitability. Our results can be adversely affected by events, such as adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, climate change, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic or other catastrophic events.Adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, climate change or catastrophic events, such as terrorist acts, can adversely impact restaurant sales. Natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and severe adverse weather conditions, climate change and health pandemics (such as COVID-19) whether occurring in the United States or abroad, can keep customers in the affected area from dining out, adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, cause damage to or closure of restaurants and result in lost opportunities for our restaurants. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.Measures implemented to reduce the spread of COVID-19 have adversely affected workforces, customers, consumer sentiment, economies and financial markets, and, along with decreased consumer spending, have led to an economic downturn in many of our markets. As a result of COVID-19, we and many of our franchisees experienced reduced operating hours and dining-room closures, some of which are still fully or partially continuing. While many markets have reopened for dine-in guests, the capacity may be limited, and local conditions may lead again to 13Table of Contentsclosures or increased limitations. As a result of COVID-19, restaurant traffic and system-wide sales were negatively impacted. Refer to Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Revenues for more information.We cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic or when operations will cease to be affected by it. Because a large portion of our restaurant operating costs are fixed or semi-fixed in nature, the loss of sales during these periods hurts our and our franchisees’ operating margins and can result in restaurant operating losses and our loss of royalties. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and has the potential to negatively impact our future financial results and depending on the duration and scope, such impact could be material.Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues. Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather; natural disasters such as floods, droughts and hurricanes; health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19); shortages in the availability of truck drivers; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; trade barriers; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; animal disease outbreaks; or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs or reduce revenues and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.The large number of Company-owned restaurants concentrated in Texas, Florida and California makes us susceptible to changes in economic and other trends in those regions. A high concentration of our Company-owned restaurants are located in Texas, Florida and California comprising 19.4%, 12.6% and 10.1%, respectively, as of June 30, 2021. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states. Negative publicity, local economic conditions, health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19), local strikes, energy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters in regions where our restaurants are highly concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For example, declines in oil prices may increase levels of unemployment and cause other economic pressures that result in lower sales and profits at our restaurants in oil market regions of Texas and surrounding areas.The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth. We have a significant percentage of system-wide restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to require our franchisees to maintain brand consistency, the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day oversight of these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control. Our reputation and financial results may be negatively impacted by: franchisee defaults in their obligations to us; limitations on our ability to enforce franchise obligations due to bankruptcy proceedings or differences in legal remedies in international markets; franchisee failures to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; franchisee failures to meet obligations to pay employees; and franchisees’ failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements.Additionally, our international franchisees are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees, and royalties paid to us may decrease if their businesses are negatively impacted. These risks include:•Difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to domestic operations;•Changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;•Challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and•Differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, social and political conditions.14Table of ContentsChallenges to the retail industry may negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants. Other tenants at retail centers in which we are located or have executed leases may fail to open or may cease operations as a result of challenges specific to the retail industry, including competition from online retailers. The retail industry has been particularly hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with many locations closing for extended periods of time and have yet to reopen. A number of prominent retail chains have also declared bankruptcy, including those that are anchor tenants in retail centers where we have locations.Decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers and changes in guest visits to the retail centers in which we are located, whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, may negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants. Inflation and fluctuations in energy costs may increase our operating expenses. We have in the past, and are currently experiencing the impacts of inflation and fluctuations in utility and energy costs. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. Fluctuations and increases in utility and energy costs have also increased our operating expenses on regional and national levels, including through suppliers putting pressure on margins by passing on higher prices for petroleum-based fuels. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, or by implementing alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business. We regard our Chili’s® and Maggiano’s® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other entities. Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs. Some business processes are or may in the future be outsourced to third parties. Such processes include certain information technology processes, gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.15Table of ContentsInformation and Technology Related RisksWe are exposed to risks related to cyber security and protection of confidential information, and failure to protect the integrity and security of payment card or individually identifiable information of our guests and teammates or confidential and proprietary information of the Company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues, increased costs and litigation. Our technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our guests and team members, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, and a significant portion of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. If our technology systems, or those of third-party services providers we rely upon, are compromised as a result of a cyber-attack (including whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or social engineering) or other external or internal method, it could result in an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. The cyber risks we face range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to attacks that target us due to the confidential consumer information we obtain through our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions. Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us, as well as the imposition of penalties. These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. To conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national borders, and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. The use and disclosure of such information is regulated at the federal, state and international levels, and these laws, rules and regulations are subject to change and increased enforcement activity and are increasing in complexity and number. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, imposes new responsibilities on us for the handling, disclosure and deletion of personal information for consumers who reside in California. The CCPA permits California to assess potentially significant fines for violating CCPA regulations and creates a right for individuals to bring class action suits seeking damages for violations.As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur significant additional costs in technology, third-party services and personnel to maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber-attacks. For example, the Company experienced a cyber security incident at some Chili’s locations in fiscal 2018. As a result of the incident, we have taken certain additional preventative measures to reduce cyber risks. However, we cannot provide assurance that our security frameworks and measures will be successful in preventing future cyber-attacks or data loss. We are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business. We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations 16Table of Contentsand other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.Financial RisksThe phase-out of LIBOR could increase our interest expense and have a material adverse effect on us.Borrowings under our revolving credit facility use LIBOR, the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market, as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority of the United Kingdom, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it planned to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. On March 5, 2021, however, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced its intention to cease the publication of all settings of non-U.S. dollar LIBOR and only the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021, with the publication of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR settings being discontinued after June 30, 2023. Whether another alternative reference rate attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. Although our borrowing arrangements provide for alternative base rates, those alternative base rates historically would often have led to increased interest rates, in some cases significantly higher, than those we paid based on LIBOR, and may similarly be higher in the future. Therefore, when LIBOR ceases to exist, we will likely need to agree upon a replacement index with our lenders, and the interest rate thereunder will likely change.The consequences of the phase out of LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted at this time. For example, we may not be successful in amending our borrowing arrangements to provide for a replacement rate. Any new or alternative base rate for calculating interest with respect to our outstanding indebtedness may not be as favorable or perform in the same manner as LIBOR and could lead to an increase in our interest expense or could impact our ability to refinance some or all of our existing indebtedness. In addition, the transition process may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in financial markets, which could also have an adverse effect on us whether or not any replacement rate applicable to our borrowings is affected. Any such effects of the transition away from LIBOR, as well as other unforeseen impacts, may result in increased interest expense and other expenses, difficulties, complications or delays in connection with future financing efforts or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Downgrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Credit rating agencies have, and in the future may, change their credit rating for us, among other things, based on the performance of our business, our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding public debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be further lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. A downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things:•Increase our cost of borrowing;•Limit our ability to access capital;•Result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur, including restrictions on our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;•Require us to provide collateral for any future borrowings; and •Adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities.These ratings and our current credit condition affect, among other things, our ability to access new capital. Negative changes to these ratings may result in more stringent covenants and higher interest rates under the terms of any new debt agreement. Our credit ratings could be further lowered, or rating agencies could issue adverse commentaries in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, a weakening of our financial condition, including any further increase in our leverage or 17Table of Contentsdecrease in our profitability or cash flows, could adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary funds, could result in a credit rating downgrade or change in outlook, or could otherwise increase our cost of borrowing.Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. We perform our annual goodwill impairment tests in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. Although no triggering event had been identified in our regular goodwill impairment assessment performed at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we determined during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 that the reduced cash flow projections and the significant decline in our market capitalization as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Based on our assessment, we determined that our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were not impaired. Additionally, we updated the assessment during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and determined no triggering event existed based on improved market value and actual results compared to projections in the quantitative assessment prepared in the third quarter. We performed our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and no indicators of impairment were identified. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified through the end of fiscal 2021. This assessment is predicated on our ability to continue to operate dining and banquet rooms, and generate off-premise sales at our restaurants. Management’s judgment about the short and long term impacts of the pandemic could change as additional facts become known and therefore affect these conclusions. We will continue to monitor and evaluate our results and evaluate the likelihood of any potential impairment charges at our reporting units.It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for the recognition of impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.Changes to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets. We make certain estimates and projections with respect to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. For example, in fiscal 2021, we recognized $3.0 million of long-lived asset and lease asset impairment charges as a result of decreased cash flows and it is possible that we may incur similar charges in greater amounts in the future. Refer to Note 1 - Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within Part II, Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. The projection of future cash flows used in the analyses requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.Legal and Regulatory RisksLitigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance. We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business or out of special circumstances. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food-borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the food service industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. It is also possible that team members, guests or others could make claims against the Company as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the nature and scope of such matters, if any, is unknown because the pandemic is novel. Our franchise activity also 18Table of Contentscreates a risk of us being named as a joint employer of workers of franchisees for alleged violations of labor and wage laws. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expenses, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Publicly traded companies also may become the target of shareholder activism, which could take many form or arise in a variety of situations. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and legal fees and divert management’s and our Board of Directors’ attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.From time to time we may implement measures that make it more difficult for an activist investor or potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire the Company through a merger or similar transaction. These measures may discourage investment in our common stock and may delay or discourage acquisitions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares over the then-current market price.Employment and labor laws and regulations may increase the cost of labor for our restaurants. We are subject to various federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations that govern employment and labor matters, including, employment discrimination, minimum wages, work scheduling, overtime, tip credits, tax reporting, working conditions, safety standards, family leave and immigration status. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity or litigation. Some states and localities have, and many others are contemplating, increases to their minimum wage and tip credit wage, and such increases can have a significant impact on our labor costs. Similarly, any government actions related to employee compensation or employer liability in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, whether temporary or permanent, could also materially increase our costs. In addition, new employment or labor laws may mandate additional benefits for employees or impose additional obligations that may adversely impact the costs of labor, the availability of labor and our business operations. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can offset all of the costs associated with compliance.Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and which increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings. Among other laws and regulations, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the design and operation of facilities, minimum wage, licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies, nutritional content and menu labeling, including the Affordable Care Act, which requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain state and local jurisdictions are enacting certain health, safety and other regulations that impact or require us to modify our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, 19Table of Contentschanges in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of these laws.We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the United States and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance.We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations which govern the offer and sale of franchises and which may supersede the terms of franchise agreements between us and our franchisees. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and our franchisees. Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state, local, and international authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities inside and outside of the United States in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.We are subject to the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our processes for designing and implementing effective internal controls involve continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business as well as in the economic and regulatory environments. As a result, we expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take as part of this effort will be sufficient to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in consolidated financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, or result in regulatory scrutiny, penalties or shareholder litigation, all of which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.20Table of ContentsMacroeconomic and Industry RisksCompetition may adversely affect our operations and financial results. The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, convenience, and type and quality of food. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains. The casual dining segment of the restaurant industry has not seen significant growth in customer traffic in recent years, and seen a significant decrease as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. If these trends continue, our ability to grow customer traffic at our restaurants (including through off-premise) will depend on our ability to increase our market share within the casual dining segment. We also face competition from quick service and fast casual restaurants; the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services; and meal kit and food delivery providers. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict. If we are unable to compete effectively, our gross sales, guest traffic and profitability may decline.Global and domestic economic conditions negatively impact consumer discretionary spending and could have a material negative effect on our financial performance. The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, which is negatively affected by global and domestic economic conditions, such as: slow or negative growth, unemployment, credit conditions and availability, volatility in financial markets, inflationary pressures, weakness in the housing market, tariffs and trade barriers, pandemics or public health concerns, and changes in government and central bank monetary policies. When economic conditions negatively affect consumer incomes, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, discretionary spending for restaurant visits will be challenged, our guest traffic may deteriorate and the average amount guests spend in our restaurants may be reduced. This will negatively impact our revenues and also result in lower royalties collected, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. This could result in further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures. There is no assurance that any governmental plans related to the economy to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will foster growth in consumer confidence, consumer incomes or consumer spending.General Risk Factors
Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance. Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements, include, without limitation, changes in financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates); increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics (such as COVID-19) or the prospects of these events; changes in consumer behaviors; changes in demographic trends; labor shortages and availability of employees; union organization; strikes; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; weather and climate change (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms); inadequate insurance coverage; and limitations imposed by our credit agreements"
14,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2019-08-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe wish to caution you that our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risk factors listed below could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, our other filings with the SEC, our news releases, or our other verbal or written communications. Additional risks and uncertainties that are currently not known or believed by us to be immaterial may also have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In any such event, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.Competition may adversely affect our operations and financial results. The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, convenience, and type and quality of food. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains. The casual dining segment of the restaurant industry has not seen significant growth in customer traffic in recent years. If this trend continues, our ability to grow customer traffic at our restaurants will depend on our ability to increase our market share within the casual dining segment. We also face competition from quick service and fast casual restaurants; the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services; and meal kit and food delivery providers. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict. If we are unable to compete effectively, our gross sales, guest traffic and profitability may decline.Changes in consumer preferences may decrease demand for food at our restaurants. Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The food service industry as a whole depends on consumer preferences at the local, regional, national and international levels. New information or changes in dietary, nutritional or health insurance guidelines, whether issued by government agencies, academic studies, advocacy organizations or similar groups, may cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our Company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.Food safety incidents at our restaurants or in our industry or supply chain may adversely affect customer perception of our brands or industry and result in declines in sales and profits. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues at one of our restaurants or our franchisees’ restaurants could irreparably damage our brand reputations and result in declines in customer traffic 9Table of Contentsand sales at our restaurants. A food safety incident may subject us to regulatory actions and litigation, including criminal investigations, and we may be required to incur significant legal costs and other liabilities. Food safety incidents may occur in our supply chain and be out of our control. Health concerns or outbreaks of disease in a food product could also reduce demand for particular menu offerings. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry generally and adversely affect our sales or cause us to incur additional costs to implement food safety protocols beyond industry standards. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.Global and domestic economic conditions may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending and could have a material negative effect on our financial performance. The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, which may be negatively affected by global and domestic economic conditions, such as: slow or negative growth, unemployment, credit conditions and availability, volatility in financial markets, inflationary pressures, weakness in the housing market, tariffs and trade barriers, and changes in government and central bank monetary policies. If economic conditions negatively affect consumer incomes, then discretionary spending for restaurant visits will be challenged, our guest traffic may deteriorate and the average amount guests spend in our restaurants may be reduced. This will negatively impact our revenues and also result in lower royalties collected, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. This could result in further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures. There is no assurance that any governmental plans related to the economy to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will foster growth in consumer confidence, consumer incomes or consumer spending.Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand. Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, customer complaints, litigation, illness or health concerns or other issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants, regardless of whether such events have a factual basis. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili’s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili’s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili’s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of the internet. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.Employment and labor laws and regulations may increase the cost of labor for our restaurants. We are subject to various federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations that govern employment and labor matters, including, employment discrimination, minimum wages, work scheduling, overtime, tip credits, tax reporting, working conditions, safety standards, family leave and immigration status. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity or litigation. Many states and localities are contemplating increases to their minimum wage and tip credit wage, and such increases can have a significant impact on our labor costs. In addition, new employment or labor laws may mandate additional benefits for employees or impose additional obligations that may adversely impact the costs of labor, the availability of labor and our business operations. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants. We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and which increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings. Among other laws and regulations, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the design and operation of facilities, minimum wage, 10Table of Contentslicensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies, nutritional content and menu labeling, including the Affordable Care Act, which requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of these laws.We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the United States and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance.We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations which govern the offer and sale of franchises and which may supersede the terms of franchise agreements between us and our franchisees. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and our franchisees. Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state, local, and international authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.Successful strategic transactions are important to our future growth and profitability. We evaluate and may pursue opportunities for growth through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, acquisition of restaurant concepts, expansion of our brands to other retail opportunities, and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. These strategic initiatives involve various inherent risks, including, without limitation:•inaccurate assessment of the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of such strategic initiatives;•damaging our reputation if the strategic initiatives result in products or services that are not of the same quality that our customers associate with our brands;•diversion of management’s attention and focus from existing operations to the strategic initiative;•inability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies;•challenges in successfully integrating an acquired business and instilling our Company culture in new management and team members;•potential loss of key personnel of any acquired business; and•unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business or the completion of a divestiture.11Table of ContentsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we executed a letter of intent to acquire 116 Chili’s restaurants owned by ERJ Dining, a franchisee, located in the Midwest United States. This acquisition is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, and represents an opportunity to create value for our shareholders and generate additional earnings and cash flow growth. We remain committed to supporting the growth of our existing franchisees. These restaurants have historically had lower annual average sales volumes. We plan to integrate the acquired restaurants into our Chili’s operations structure and to roll out processes to improve sales and margins. We also expect to remodel these restaurants and leverage technology investments in the restaurants. There is no assurance that these initiatives will achieve the sales growth and margin improvements for which we have planned with respect to this acquisition, and may adversely impact our future profitability if not met.If we are unable to successfully design and execute a business strategy plan, our gross sales and profitability may be adversely affected. Our ability to increase revenues and profitability is dependent on designing and executing effective business strategies. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees’ ability to:•increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options desired by our guests;•evolve our marketing and branding strategies in order to appeal to guests;•innovate and implement technology initiatives that provide a unique digital guest experience;•identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reimaging of existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new restaurant equipment;•grow and expand operations, including identifying available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants; and•improve the speed and quality of our service.Our partnership with DoorDash is subject to risks, and our ability to grow sales through delivery orders is uncertain.Our strategy for growth in fiscal year 2020 is dependent in part on increased sales from guests that want our food delivered to them. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, we entered into an agreement with DoorDash that allows DoorDash to be the exclusive third party delivery provider for Chili’s and Maggiano’s. We currently rely on DoorDash for the ordering and payment platforms that receive guest orders and that send orders directly to our point of sale system. These platforms could be damaged or interrupted by technological failures, cyber-attacks or other factors, which may adversely impact our sales through these channels. DoorDash generally fulfills delivery orders through drivers that are independent contractors. These drivers may make errors, fail to make timely deliveries, damage our food or poorly represent our brands, which may lead to customer disappointment, reputational harm and unmet sales expectations. Our sales may also be adversely impacted if there is a shortage in drivers that are willing and available to make deliveries from our restaurants.Because we have partnered exclusively with DoorDash, our delivery business and growth expectations may be negatively impacted if DoorDash is not able to effectively compete with other restaurant delivery providers for end consumers, capital, and delivery drivers or DoorDash ceases or reduces operations. Delivery, as well as other DoorDash offerings that we may test, are relatively new services, and it is difficult for us to anticipate the level of sales they may generate, operational challenges we may face or the experiences our guests will have with these offerings. These factors may adversely impact our sales and our brand reputation. We also incur additional costs associated with delivery orders, and it is possible that these orders could cannibalize more profitable in-restaurant visits or carry out orders.12Table of ContentsLoss of key management personnel could hurt our business and limit our ability to operate and grow successfully. Our success depends, to a significant extent, on our leadership team and other key management personnel. These personnel serve to maintain a corporate vision for our Company, execute our business strategy, and maintain consistency in the operating standards of our restaurants. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable key management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer.Failure to recruit, train and retain high-quality restaurant management and team members may result in lower guest satisfaction and lower sales and profitability. Our restaurant-level management and team members are largely responsible for the quality of our service. Our guests may be dissatisfied and our sales may decline if we fail to recruit, train and retain managers and team members that effectively implement our business strategy and provide high quality guest service. There is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. If we experience high turnover, we may experience higher labor costs and have a shortage of adequate management personnel required for future growth.Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business. There has been a marked increase in the use of social media and similar platforms which allow individual access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants’ post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests and may harm our performance, prospects or business, regardless of the information’s accuracy.As part of our marketing strategy, we rely on search engine marketing, social media and new technology platforms to attract and retain guests and maintain brand relevance. Our strategy and initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without improvement in guest traffic or brand relevance. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.We are exposed to risks related to cyber security and protection of confidential information, and failure to protect the integrity and security of payment card or individually identifiable information of our guests and teammates or confidential and proprietary information of the Company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues, increased costs and litigation. Our technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our guests and team members, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, and a significant portion of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. If our technology systems, or those of third party services providers we rely upon, are compromised as a result of a cyber-attack (including whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or social engineering) or other external or internal method, it could result in an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. The cyber risks we face range from cyber-attacks common to most industries, to attacks that target us due to the confidential consumer information we obtain through our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions. Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us, as well as the imposition of penalties. These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. To conduct our operations, we regularly move data across national borders, and consequently are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. The use and disclosure of such information is regulated at the federal, state and international levels, and these laws, rules and regulations are subject to change and increased enforcement activity. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur significant additional costs in technology, 13Table of Contentsthird-party services and personnel to maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber-attacks. As further described below, the Company experienced a cyber security incident at some Chili’s locations in fiscal 2018. As a result of the incident, we have taken certain additional preventative measures to reduce cyber risks. However, we cannot provide assurance that our security frameworks and measures will be successful in preventing future cyber-attacks or data loss. In addition, we expect the cost to maintain cyber liability insurance in the future will materially increase as a result of the incident.We have incurred and in the future may incur costs and reputational harm resulting from the unauthorized access or acquisition of confidential consumer information related to our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions.On May 12, 2018, we issued a public statement notifying guests that we had discovered that credit and debit card numbers and related payment card information may have been acquired from Chili’s locations without authorization as a result of a malware attack. The Company engaged third-party forensic firms and cooperated with law enforcement to investigate the matter. Based on the investigation of our third-party forensic experts, we believe most Company-owned Chili’s restaurants were impacted by the malware during time frames that vary by restaurant, but we believe in each case began no earlier than March 21, 2018 and ended no later than April 22, 2018.As a result of the incident, we have been assessed with financial responsibility by certain payment card companies for card issuer losses, card replacement costs and other charges issued by payment card companies. In addition, we are the defendant in a purported class action lawsuit, alleging that we negligently failed to provide adequate security to protect the payment card information of the plaintiffs, causing those individuals to suffer financial losses. We may also be subject to fines and penalties imposed by state and federal regulators relating to or arising out of the incident. In the future we may become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also become subject to additional lawsuits or proceedings relating to the incident. While we do not acknowledge responsibility to pay any such amounts imposed or demanded, these proceedings and demands may result in significant related settlement costs.Since the incident, through June 26, 2019, we have incurred costs of $4.2 million related to the cyber security incident, and expect to incur significant legal and professional services expenses associated with the incident in future periods. Although we maintain cyber liability insurance, we are not able to reliably forecast all of the losses that may occur as a result of the incident or whether such costs will be covered by insurance. It is possible that our losses will be in excess of our cyber liability insurance coverage applicable to the incident. If losses exceed our cyber liability insurance coverage such excess losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods.Further, the incident may have a negative impact on our reputation and cause guests to lose confidence in our ability to safeguard their information. We are unable to definitively determine the impact to our relationship with our guests and whether we will need to engage in significant promotional or other activities to rebuild our relationship with our guests. If the Company experiences another cyber security incident in the future, we believe it will be even more difficult to regain the trust of our guests and to rebuild our reputation.Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues. Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather; natural disasters such as floods, droughts and hurricanes; shortages in the availability of truck drivers; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; trade barriers; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; animal disease outbreaks; or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply-chain risk could increase our costs or reduce revenues and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.14Table of ContentsThe large number of Company-owned restaurants concentrated in Texas, Florida and California makes us susceptible to changes in economic and other trends in those regions. A high concentration of our Company-owned restaurants are located in Texas, Florida and California comprising 21.6%, 13.8% and 11.7%, respectively, as of June 26, 2019. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states. Negative publicity, local economic conditions, local strikes, energy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters in regions where our restaurants are highly concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For example, declines in oil prices may increase levels of unemployment and cause other economic pressures that result in lower sales and profits at our restaurants in oil market regions of Texas and surrounding areas.Litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance. We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business or out of special circumstances. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food-borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. Our franchise activity also creates a risk of us being named as a joint employer of workers of franchisees for alleged violations of labor and wage laws. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth. We have a significant percentage of system-wide restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to require our franchisees to maintain brand consistency, the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day oversight of these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control. Our reputation and financial results may be negatively impacted by: franchisee defaults in their obligations to us; limitations on our ability to enforce franchise obligations due to bankruptcy proceedings or differences in legal remedies in international markets; franchisee failures to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; franchisee failures to meet obligations to pay employees; and franchisees’ failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements.Additionally, our international franchisees are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees, and royalties paid to us may decrease if their businesses are negatively impacted. These risks include:•difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to United States operations;•changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;•challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and•differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, social and political conditions.Downgrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Credit rating agencies may change their credit rating for us, among other things, based on the performance of our business, our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding public debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be further lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant. A downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things:•increase our cost of borrowing;15Table of Contents•limit our ability to access capital;•result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur, including restrictions on our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;•require us to provide collateral for any future borrowings; and •adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities.Inflation and fluctuations in energy costs may increase our operating expenses. We have experienced impact from inflation and fluctuations in utility and energy costs. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. Fluctuations and increases in utility and energy costs have also increased our operating expenses on regional and national levels, including through suppliers putting pressure on margins by passing on higher prices for petroleum-based fuels. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, or by implementing alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.Challenges to the retail industry may negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants. Other tenants at retail centers in which we are located or have executed leases may fail to open or may cease operations as a result of challenges specific to the retail industry, including competition from online retailers. Decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers and changes in guest visits to the retail centers in which we are located may negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants. We are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business. We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations, and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business. We regard our Chili’s® and Maggiano’s® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other entities. Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise 16Table of Contentsa restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs. Some business processes are or may in the future be outsourced to third parties. Such processes include certain information technology processes, gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. We perform our annual goodwill impairment tests in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.Changes to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets. We make certain estimates and projections with respect to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. The projection of future cash flows used in the analyses requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.We are subject to the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our processes for designing and implementing effective internal controls involve continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business as well as in the economic and regulatory environments. As a result, we expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take as part of this effort will be sufficient to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in consolidated financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, or result in regulatory scrutiny, penalties or shareholder litigation, all of which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. 17Table of ContentsOur business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expenses, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies recently. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and legal fees and divert management’s and our board of directors’ attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.From time to time we may implement measures that make it more difficult for an activist investor or potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire the Company through a merger or similar transaction. These measures may discourage investment in our common stock and may delay or discourage acquisitions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares over the then-current market price.Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance. Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements, include, without limitation, changes in financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates); increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events; changes in consumer behaviors; changes in demographic trends; labor shortages and availability of employees; union organization; strikes; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms); inadequate insurance coverage; and limitations imposed by our credit agreements"
1,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2018-08-27,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe wish to caution you that our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risk factors listed below could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, our other filings with the SEC, our news releases, or our other verbal or written communications. Additional risks and uncertainties that are currently not known or believed by us to be immaterial may also have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In any such event, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.Competition may adversely affect our operations and financial results.The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, convenience, and type and quality of food. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains. The casual dining segment of the restaurant industry has not seen significant growth in customer traffic in recent years. If this trend continues, our ability to grow customer traffic at our restaurants will depend on our ability to increase our market share within the casual dining segment. We also face competition from quick service and fast casual restaurants; the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services; and meal kit and food delivery providers. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict. If we are unable to compete effectively, our gross sales and profitability may decline.9Table of ContentsChanges in consumer preferences may decrease demand for food at our restaurants.Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The food service industry as a whole depends on consumer preferences at the local, regional, national and international levels. New information or changes in dietary, nutritional or health insurance guidelines, whether issued by government agencies, academic studies, advocacy organizations or similar groups, may cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.Food safety incidents at our restaurants or in our industry or supply chain may adversely affect customer perception of our brands or industry and result in declines in sales and profits. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues at one of our restaurants or our franchisees’ restaurants could irreparably damage our brand reputations and result in declines in customer traffic and sales at our restaurants. A food safety incident may subject us to regulatory actions and litigation, including criminal investigations, and we may be required to incur significant legal costs and other liabilities. Food safety incidents may occur in our supply chain and be out of our control. Health concerns or outbreaks of disease in a food product could also reduce demand for particular menu offerings. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry generally and adversely affect our sales or cause us to incur additional costs to implement food safety protocols beyond industry standards. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.Global and domestic economic conditions may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending and could have a material negative effect on our financial performance.The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, which may be negatively affected by global and domestic economic conditions, such as: slow or negative growth, unemployment, credit conditions and availability, volatility in financial markets, inflationary pressures, weakness in the housing market, tariffs and trade barriers, and changes in government and central bank monetary policies. If economic conditions negatively affect consumer incomes, then discretionary spending for restaurant visits will be challenged, our guest traffic may deteriorate and the average amount guests spend in our restaurants may be reduced. This will negatively impact our revenues and also result in lower royalties collected, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. This could result in further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures. There is no assurance that any governmental plan to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will foster growth in consumer confidence, consumer incomes or consumer spending.Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, customer complaints, litigation, illness or health concerns or other issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants, regardless of whether such events have a factual basis. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili’s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili’s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili’s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of the internet. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.Employment and labor laws and regulations may increase the cost of labor for our restaurants.We are subject to various federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations that govern employment and labor matters, including, employment discrimination, minimum wages, work scheduling, overtime, tip credits, tax reporting, working conditions, safety standards, family leave and immigration status. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in 10Table of Contentsnegative publicity or litigation. Many states and localities are contemplating increases to their minimum wage and tip credit wage, and such increases can have a significant impact on our labor costs. In addition, new employment or labor laws may mandate additional benefits for employees or impose additional obligations that may adversely impact the costs of labor, the availability of labor and our business operations. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants.We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and which increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings. Among other laws and regulations, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the design and operation of facilities, licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies, nutritional content and menu labeling, including the Affordable Care Act which requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of these laws.We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the U.S. and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance.We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations which govern the offer and sale of franchises and which may supersede the terms of franchise agreements between us and our franchisees. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and our franchisees. Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state, local, and international authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.Successful strategic transactions are important to our future growth and profitability.We evaluate and may pursue opportunities for growth through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, acquisition of restaurant concepts, expansion of our brands to other retail opportunities, and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. These strategic initiatives involve various inherent risks, including, without limitation:•inaccurate assessment of the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of such strategic initiatives;11Table of Contents•damaging our reputation if the strategic initiatives result in products or services that are not of the same quality that our customers associate with our brands;•diversion of management’s attention and focus from existing operations to the strategic initiative;•inability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies;•challenges in successfully integrating an acquired business and instilling our company culture in new management and team members;•potential loss of key personnel of any acquired business; and•unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business or the completion of a divestiture.If we are unable to successfully design and execute a business strategy plan, our gross sales and profitability may be adversely affected.Our ability to increase revenues and profitability is dependent on designing and executing effective business strategies. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees’ ability to:•increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options desired by our guests;•evolve our marketing and branding strategies in order to appeal to guests;•innovate and implement technology initiatives that provide a unique digital guest experience;•identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reimaging of existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new restaurant equipment;•grow and expand operations, including identifying available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants; and•improve the speed and quality of our service.Loss of key management personnel could hurt our business and limit our ability to operate and grow successfully.Our success depends, to a significant extent, on our leadership team and other key management personnel. These personnel serve to maintain a corporate vision for our Company, execute our business strategy, and maintain consistency in the operating standards of our restaurants. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable key management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer.Failure to recruit, train and retain high-quality restaurant management and team members may result in lower guest satisfaction and lower sales and profitability.Our restaurant-level management and team members are largely responsible for the quality of our service. Our guests may be dissatisfied and our sales may decline if we fail to recruit, train and retain managers and team members that effectively implement our business strategy and provide high quality guest service. There is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. If we experience high turnover, we may experience higher labor costs and have a shortage of adequate management personnel required for future growth.Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business.There has been a marked increase in the use of social media and similar platforms which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately 12Table of Contentspublish the content their subscribers and participants’ post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests and may harm our performance, prospects or business, regardless of the information’s accuracy.As part of our marketing strategy, we rely on search engine marketing, social media and new technology platforms to attract and retain guests and maintain brand relevance. Our strategy and initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without improvement in guest traffic or brand relevance. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.Failure to protect the integrity and security of payment card or individually identifiable information of our guests and teammates or confidential and proprietary information of the Company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues, increased costs and litigation.A significant portion of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Our technology systems contain personal, financial and other information that is entrusted to us by our guests and team members, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. If our technology systems, or those of third party services providers we rely upon, are compromised as a result of a cyber attack (including whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or social engineering) or other external or internal method, it could result in an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, and financial condition. Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us, as well as the imposition of penalties. These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personal data. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur significant additional costs in technology, third-party services and personnel to maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks. As further described below, the Company experienced a cyber security incident at some Chili’s locations. As a result of the incident, we have taken certain additional preventative measures to reduce cyber risks. However, we cannot provide assurance that our security frameworks and measures  will be successful in preventing future cyber attacks or data loss. In addition, we expect the cost to maintain cyber liability insurance in the future will materially increase as a result of the incident.We have incurred and in the future may incur costs and reputational harm resulting from the unauthorized access or acquisition of confidential consumer information related to our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions.On May 12, 2018, we issued a public statement notifying guests that we had discovered that credit and debit card numbers and related payment card information may have been acquired from Chili’s locations without authorization as a result of a malware attack. The Company has engaged third-party forensic firms and cooperated with law enforcement to investigate the matter. Based on the investigation of our third-party forensic experts, we believe most Company-owned Chili’s restaurants were impacted by the malware during time frames that vary by restaurant, but we believe in each case beginning no earlier than March 21, 2018 and ending no later than April 22, 2018. As a result of the incident, we may incur losses associated with anticipated claims by payment card companies for card issuer losses and card replacement costs, as well as fines, penalties and other charges issued by payment card companies. In addition, we are the defendant in purported class action lawsuits, alleging that we negligently failed to provide adequate security to protect the payment card information of the plaintiffs, causing those individuals to suffer financial losses. We may also be subject to fines and penalties imposed by state and federal regulators relating to or arising out of the incident. In the future we may become subject to additional claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also become subject to additional lawsuits or proceedings relating to the incident. While we do not acknowledge responsibility to pay any such amounts imposed or demanded, these proceedings and demands may result in related settlement costs. 13Table of ContentsAlthough we maintain cyber liability insurance, we are not able to reliably forecast all of the losses that may occur as a result of the incident. It is possible that our losses will be in excess of our cyber liability insurance coverage applicable to the incident. If losses exceed our cyber liability insurance coverage such excess losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in future periods. Further, the incident may have a negative impact on our reputation and cause guests to lose confidence in our ability to safeguard their information. We are unable to definitively determine the impact to our relationship with our guests and whether we will need to engage in significant promotional or other activities to rebuild our relationship with our guests. If the Company experiences another cyber security incident in the future, we believe it will be even more difficult to regain the trust of our guests and to rebuild our reputation.Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues.Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather; natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes; shortages in the availability of truck drivers; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; animal disease outbreaks; or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply-chain risk could increase our costs or reduce revenues and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.The large number of Company-owned restaurants concentrated in Texas, Florida and California makes us susceptible to changes in economic and other trends in those regions.A high concentration of our company-owned restaurants are located in Texas, Florida and California comprising 21.7%, 13.8% and 11.7%, respectively, as of June 27, 2018. As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states. Negative publicity, local economic conditions, local strikes, energy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters in regions where our restaurants are highly concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. For example, declines in oil prices may increase levels of unemployment and cause other economic pressures that result in lower sales and profits at our restaurants in oil market regions of Texas and surrounding areas.Litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance.We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business or out of special circumstances. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food-borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. Our franchise activity also creates a risk of us being named as a joint employer of workers of franchisees for alleged violations of labor and wage laws. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth.We have a significant percentage of system-wide restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to require our franchisees to maintain brand consistency, the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day oversight of these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control. Our reputation and financial results may be negatively impacted by: franchisee defaults in their obligations to us; limitations on our ability to enforce franchise obligations due to bankruptcy proceedings; franchisee failures to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; franchisee failures to meet obligations to pay employees; and franchisees’ failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements.14Table of ContentsAdditionally, our international franchisees are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees, and royalties paid to us may decrease if their businesses are negatively impacted. These risks include:•difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to U.S. operations;•changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;•challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and•differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, social and political conditions.Downgrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Credit rating agencies may change their credit rating for us, among other things, based on the performance of our business, our capital strategies or their overall view of our industry. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding public debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be further lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that agency’s judgment, circumstances so warrant.A downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things:•increase our cost of borrowing;•limit our ability to access capital;•result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur, including restrictions on our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;•require us to provide collateral for any future borrowings; and •adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities.Inflation and fluctuations in energy costs may increase our operating expenses.We have experienced impact from inflation and fluctuations in utility and energy costs. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. Fluctuations and increases in utility and energy costs have also increased our operating expenses on regional or national levels, including through suppliers putting pressure on margins by passing on higher prices for petroleum-based fuels. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, or by implementing alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.Challenges to the retail industry may negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants.Other tenants at retail centers in which we are located or have executed leases may fail to open or may cease operations as a result of challenges specific to the retail industry, including competition from online retailers. Decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers and changes in guest visits to the retail centers in which we are located may negatively affect guest traffic at our restaurants. We are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations, and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of 15Table of Contentsthese systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.We regard our Chili’s® and Maggiano’s® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other entities. Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.Some business processes are or may in the future be outsourced to third parties. Such processes include certain information technology processes, gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.We perform our annual goodwill impairment tests in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.16Table of ContentsChanges to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets.We make certain estimates and projections with respect to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. The projection of future cash flows used in the analyses requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.We are subject to the internal control requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which require management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and our independent auditors to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our processes for designing and implementing effective internal controls involve continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business as well as in the economic and regulatory environments. As a result, we expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take as part of this effort will be sufficient to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting. Failure to maintain effective internal controls could result in consolidated financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, or result in regulatory scrutiny, penalties or shareholder litigation, all of which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price.In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies recently. Due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and legal fees and divert management’s and our board of directors’ attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.From time to time we may implement measures that make it more difficult for an activist investor or potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire the Company through a merger or similar transaction. These measures may discourage investment in our common stock and may delay or discourage acquisitions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares over the then-current market price.Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in forward-looking statements, include, without limitation, changes in financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates); increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events; changes in consumer behaviors; changes in demographic trends; labor shortages and availability of employees; union organization; strikes; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms); inadequate insurance coverage; and limitations imposed by our credit agreements.17Table of Contents"
8,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2017-08-28,"RISK FACTORS.We wish to caution you that our business, financial condition and results of operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The risk factors listed below could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results or from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, our other filings with the SEC, our news releases, or our other verbal or written communications.  Additional risks and uncertainties that are currently not known or believed by us to be immaterial may also have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In any such event, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.  Competition may adversely affect our operations and financial results.The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, nutritional and dietary trends and food quality and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, economic conditions, population and traffic patterns. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains, some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longer operating histories than ours. The casual dining segment of the restaurant industry has not seen any significant growth in customer traffic in recent years.  If this trend continues, our ability to grow customer traffic at our restaurants will depend on our ability to increase our market share within the casual dining segment. We also face competition from quick service and fast casual restaurants; the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services; and meal kit and food delivery providers. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs.  Our restaurants also face competition from the introduction of new products and menu items by competitors, as well as substantial price discounting among offers.  Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict. If we are unable to compete effectively, we may lose customer traffic and our gross sales and profitability may decline.Changes in consumer preferences may decrease demand for food at our restaurants.Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The foodservice industry as a whole depends on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels, including the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet, nutrition, health and health insurance. Changes in nutritional or health insurance guidelines issued by federal or local government agencies, issuance of similar guidelines or statistical information by other federal, state or local municipalities, academic studies, or advocacy organizations, among other things, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.Food safety incidents at our restaurants or in our industry or supply chain may adversely affect customer perception of our brands or industry and result in declines in sales and profits. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues at one of our restaurants or our franchisees’ restaurants could irreparably damage our brand reputations and result in declines in customer traffic and sales at our restaurants. A food safety incident may subject us to regulatory actions and litigation, including criminal investigations, and we may be required to incur significant legal costs and other liabilities. Food safety incidents may occur in our supply chain and be out of our control. Health concerns or outbreaks of disease in a food product could also reduce demand for particular menu offerings. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry generally and adversely affect our sales or cause us to incur additional costs to implement food safety protocols beyond industry standards. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.7Global and domestic economic conditions may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending and could have a material negative effect on our financial performance.The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, which may be negatively affected by global and domestic economic conditions, such as: slow or negative growth, unemployment, credit conditions and availability, volatility in financial markets, inflationary pressures, weakness in the housing market, and changes in government and central bank monetary policies. If economic conditions negatively affect consumer incomes, then discretionary spending for restaurant visits will be challenged, our guest traffic may deteriorate and the average amount guests spend in our restaurants may be reduced.  This will negatively impact our revenues and also result in lower royalties collected, sales deleverage, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. This could result in further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures. There is no assurance that any governmental plan to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will foster growth in consumer confidence, consumer incomes or consumer spending.Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, customer complaints, litigation, illness or health concerns or other issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants, regardless of whether such events have a factual basis. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili’s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili’s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili’s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of the internet. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.Employment and labor laws and regulations may increase the cost of labor for our restaurants.We are subject to various federal, state and local employment and labor laws and regulations that govern employment and labor matters, including, employment discrimination, minimum wages, work scheduling, overtime, tip credits, tax reporting, working conditions, safety standards, family leave and immigration status. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity or litigation. Many states and localities are contemplating increases to their minimum wage and tip credit wage, and such increases can have a significant impact on our labor costs.  In addition, new employment or labor laws may mandate additional benefits for employees or impose additional obligations that may adversely impact the costs of labor, the availability of labor and our business operations. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants.We are subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and which increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings.  Among other laws and regulations, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to nutritional content and menu labeling, including the Affordable Care Act, which requires restaurant companies such as ours to disclose calorie information on their menus by May 2018. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of these laws.Each of our company-owned and our franchisees’ restaurants is also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality where the restaurant is located. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and approvals that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Although we do not anticipate any material difficulties occurring in the future, we cannot be certain that we, or our franchisees, will not experience material difficulties or failures that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay the opening of restaurants in the future.We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the U.S. and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. This may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an unspecified array of environmental matters. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance. Further, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay, prevent or make cost prohibitive the continuing operations of an existing restaurant or the development of new restaurants in particular locations.8We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations which govern the offer and sale of franchises and which may supersede the terms of franchise agreements between us and our franchisees.  Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and our franchisees. Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees and joint venture partners. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues.Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather; natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; animal disease outbreaks; or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply-chain risk could increase our costs or reduce revenues and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.Successful strategic transactions are important to our future growth and profitability.We evaluate and may pursue opportunities for growth through new and existing franchise partners, joint venture investments, acquisition of restaurant concepts, expansion of our brands to other retail opportunities, and strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures. These strategic initiatives involve various inherent risks, including, without limitation:inaccurate assessment of the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of such strategic initiatives;damaging our reputation if the strategic initiatives result in products or services that are not of the same quality that our customers associate with our brands;diversion of management’s attention and focus from existing operations to the strategic initiative;inability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies;challenges in successfully integrating an acquired business and instilling our company culture in new management and team members;potential loss of key personnel of any acquired business; andunanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business or the completion of a divestiture.If we are unable to successfully design and execute a business strategy plan, our gross sales and profitability may be adversely affected.Our ability to increase gross sales and profitability is dependent on designing and executing effective business strategies. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees’ ability to:9increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options desired by our guests;evolve our marketing and branding strategies in order to appeal to guests;innovate and implement technology initiatives that provide a unique digital guest experience;identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reimaging of existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new restaurant equipment;grow and expand operations, including identifying available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants; andimprove the speed and quality of our service.Loss of key management personnel could hurt our business and limit our ability to operate and grow successfully.Our success depends, to a significant extent, on our leadership team and other key management personnel. These personnel serve to maintain a corporate vision for our Company, execute our business strategy, and maintain consistency in the operating standards of our restaurants. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable key management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer.  Failure to recruit, train and retain high-quality restaurant management and team members may result in lower guest satisfaction and lower sales and profitability.Our restaurant-level management and team members are largely responsible for the quality of our service. Our guests may be dissatisfied and our sales may decline if we fail to recruit, train and retain managers and team members that effectively implement our business strategy and provide high quality guest service. There is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. If we experience high turnover, we may experience higher labor costs and have a shortage of adequate management personnel required for future growth.  Slow economic growth, a recession or changes in the retail industry could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results.During slow economic growth or a recession, our landlords may be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition, other tenants at retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located or have executed leases may fail to open or may cease operations as a result of macro-economic factors or challenges specific to the retail industry, including competition from online retailers. If our landlords fail to satisfy required co-tenancies, this may result in us or our franchisees terminating leases or delaying openings in these locations. Also, decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers in which we are located may affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth.We have a significant percentage of system-wide restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to require our franchisees to maintain brand consistency, the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day oversight of these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control. These risks include: franchisee defaults in their obligations to us, such as payments to us or maintenance and improvements obligations; limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; franchisees’ inability to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; franchisees’ inability to meet rent obligations on leases on which we retain contingent liability; and franchisees’ failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements.Additionally, our international franchisees and joint venture partners are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees. These risks include:difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to U.S. operations;changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; anddifferences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, social and political conditions.10Downgrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Credit rating agencies continually review their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us.  Credit rating agencies also evaluate the industries in which we and our affiliates operate as a whole and may change their credit rating for us based on their overall view of such industries.  There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding public debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be further lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that agency's judgment, circumstances so warrant.A downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things:limit our ability to access capital or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all;result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur;cause us to refinance indebtedness with less favorable terms and conditions, which debt may require collateral and restrict, among other things, our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;increase our cost of borrowing;adversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities; andimpair our business, financial condition and results of operations.Inflation and fluctuations in energy costs may increase our operating expenses.We have experienced impact from inflation and fluctuations in utility and energy costs. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses.  Fluctuations and increases in utility and energy costs have also increased our operating expenses on regional or national levels, including through suppliers putting pressure on margins by passing on higher prices for petroleum-based fuels. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, or by implementing alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.Our sales volumes generally decrease in winter months in North America.Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally and are generally higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months, which may cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business.There has been a marked increase in the use of social media and similar platforms which allow individuals access to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons. Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests and may harm our performance, prospects or business, regardless of the information's accuracy.As part of our marketing strategy, we rely on search engine marketing, social media and new technology platforms to attract and retain guests and maintain brand relevance. Our strategy and initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without improvement in guest traffic or brand relevance. In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information. The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.Litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance.We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food-borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. Our franchise activity also creates a risk of us being named as a joint employer of workers of franchisees for alleged violations of labor and wage laws. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity.  Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or 11an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.  We are dependent on information technology, and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. A security breach or cyber attack could include theft of credit card data or other personal information as well as our intellectual property. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.Failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and teammates and confidential and proprietary information of the company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues and litigation.We receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and team members in our information technology systems, such as point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including our rewards program. Use of this information is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third party contracts.  Additionally, our systems contain proprietary and confidential information related to our business. If our or our business associates' information systems are compromised as a result of a cyber attack or other external or internal method, or we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in a violation of the laws and regulations, and an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, results of operations and financial condition. Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us or the imposition of penalties. These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. Like many other retail companies, we experience frequent attempts to compromise our systems but none have resulted in a material breach. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur additional costs in technology, third-party services and personnel to remain in compliance and maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks. Our security frameworks prevent breaches of our systems and data loss, but these measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.We regard our Chili's® and Maggiano's® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts. We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement. We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons. Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant. Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.Some business processes are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include certain information technology processes, gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.12Disruptions in the global financial markets may affect our business plan by adversely impacting the availability and cost of credit.We are dependent on a stable, liquid, and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments. In particular, we have historically relied on the public debt markets and bank credit facilities to fund portions of our capital investments and share repurchase program. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets. Disruptions to the global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit. There can be no assurance that various U.S. and world government responses to disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets or increase liquidity or the availability of credit.  The large number of Company-owned restaurants concentrated in Texas, Florida and California makes us susceptible to changes in economic and other trends in those regions.A high concentration of our company-owned restaurants are located in Texas, Florida and California.  As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states. For example, declining oil prices has caused increased levels of unemployment and other economic pressures that have resulted in lower sales and profits at our restaurants in some oil market regions of Texas and surrounding areas. Negative publicity, local strikes, energy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters in regions where our restaurants are highly concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.We perform our annual goodwill impairment tests in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.Changes to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets.We make certain estimates and projections with respect to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. The projection of future cash flows used in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires management and auditors to assess the effectiveness of internal controls. As further described in Item 9A of this Form 10-K, management has concluded that, because of a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to accounting for deferred income taxes, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 28, 2017. If we fail to correct this material weakness in our internal controls, or having corrected such material weakness, thereafter fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we could be subjected to regulatory scrutiny, penalties or shareholder litigation. In addition, continued or future failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result in consolidated financial statements that do not accurately reflect our financial condition, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. We cannot assure you that the measures we will take will remediate any material weaknesses identified or that we may identify in the future, or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial process and reporting in the future.Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and current SEC regulations, we are required to prepare assessments regarding internal control over financial reporting and furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting. Failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment or complete our Section 404 certifications could have a material adverse effect on our stock price.13Any failure to complete our assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, to remediate any material weaknesses or to implement new or improved controls could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of the periodic management evaluations of our internal controls and, in the case of a failure to remediate any material weaknesses that we may identify, would adversely affect the annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that are required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Inadequate internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.We may not be able to achieve our target for growth in total return to shareholders.We define our total returns as earnings per share growth plus our dividend yield.  Comparable restaurant sales that are below our target, slowing growth of our concepts domestically, a decline in growth of our international business, any event that substantially increases our operating costs or any event that decreases our cash flow and ability to repurchase our stock or pay dividends as expected could, negatively affect our stock price, result in lower than targeted earnings per share growth and reduce total returns to shareholders.Our business and operation could be negatively affected if we become subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of investment strategy and impact our stock price.In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. Shareholder activism, which could take many forms or arise in a variety of situations, has been increasing in publicly traded companies recently. While we are currently not subject to any securities litigation or shareholder activism, due to the potential volatility of our stock price and for a variety of other reasons, we may in the future become the target of securities litigation or shareholder activism. Securities litigation and shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs and divert management’s and our board of directors’ attention and resources from our business. Additionally, such securities litigation and shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with service providers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel. Also, we may be required to incur significant legal fees and other expenses related to any securities litigation and activist shareholder matters. Further, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any securities litigation and shareholder activism.From time to time we may implement measures that make it more difficult for an activist investor or potential acquirer to purchase a large portion of our securities, to initiate a tender offer or a proxy contest, or to acquire the Company through a merger or similar transaction. These measures may discourage investment in our common stock and may delay or discourage acquisitions that would result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares over the then-current market price.Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements, include, without limitation, changes in financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates); increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events; changes in consumer behaviors; changes in demographic trends; labor shortages and availability of employees; union organization; strikes; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms); inadequate insurance coverage; and limitations imposed by our credit agreements"
6,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2016-08-29,"RISK FACTORS.We wish to caution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and investing in our securities involves a degree of risk. The factors listed below are important because they could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases, written or electronic communications, and verbal statements by our representatives.  In any such event, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.You should be aware that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause our or our industry’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words like “believes,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “expects,” and other similar expressions that convey uncertainty about future events or outcomes. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Competition may adversely affect our operations and financial results.The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, nutritional and dietary trends and food quality, and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, economic conditions, population and traffic patterns. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains, some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longer operating histories than ours. The U.S. total employment market is growing, and there is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. The casual dining segment has not seen any significant growth in customer traffic in recent years.  If this trend continues, our ability to grow customer traffic at our restaurants will depend on our ability to increase our market share within the casual dining segment.  We continue to face competition as a result of several factors, including quick service and fast casual restaurants also offering high quality food and beverage choices and the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs.Our restaurants also face competition from the introduction of new products and menu items by competitors, as well as substantial price discounting among other offers, and are likely to continue to face such future competition in light of the slow paced economic growth. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict and will be influenced by competitive product offerings, pricing and promotions offered by competitors. Our ability to differentiate our brands from their competitors, which is in part limited by the advertising spend available to us and by consumer perception, cannot be assured. These factors could reduce the gross sales or profitability at our restaurants, which would decrease revenues or profitability generated by company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchisees.7Changes in consumer preferences may decrease demand for food at our restaurants.Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The foodservice industry as a whole rests on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels, including the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet, nutrition, health and health insurance. We and our franchisees depend on the sustained demand for our products, which may be affected by factors outside of our control. Changes in nutritional or health insurance guidelines issued by federal or local government agencies, issuance of similar guidelines or statistical information by other federal, state or local municipalities, academic studies, or advocacy organizations, among other things, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our company-owned restaurants and the royalty  and other payments we receive from franchisees.Food safety incidents at our restaurants or in our industry or supply chain may adversely affect customer perception of our brands or industry and result in declines in sales and profits. Regardless of the source or cause, any report of food-borne illnesses or other food safety issues at one of our restaurants or our franchisees’ restaurants could irreparably damage our brand reputations and result in declines in customer traffic and sales at our restaurants. A food safety incident may subject us to regulatory actions and litigation, including criminal investigations, and we may be required to incur significant legal costs and other liabilities. Food safety incidents may occur in our supply chain and be out of our control. Health concerns or outbreaks of disease in a food product could also reduce demand for particular menu offerings. Even instances of food-borne illness, food tampering or food contamination occurring solely at restaurants of our competitors could result in negative publicity about the restaurant industry generally and adversely affect our sales or cause us to incur additional costs to implement food safety protocols beyond industry standards. The occurrence of food-borne illnesses or food safety issues could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs and lower margins.Global and domestic economic conditions may negatively impact consumer discretionary spending and could have a materially negative affect on our financial performance.The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, which may be negatively affected by global and domestic economic conditions, such as: slow or negative growth, unemployment, credit conditions and availability, volatility in financial markets, inflationary pressures, weakness in the housing market, and changes in government and central bank monetary policies. If economic conditions negatively affect consumer incomes, then discretionary spending for restaurant visits will be challenged and our business, results of operations and ability to comply with the covenants under our credit facility could be materially affected. Deterioration in guest traffic or a reduction in the average amount guests spend in our restaurants will negatively impact our revenues. These conditions will also result in lower royalties collected, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. In turn, the impact of these pressures could result in reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures. There is no assurance that any governmental plan to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will foster growth in consumer confidence, stabilize the financial markets, increase liquidity and the availability of credit, or result in lower unemployment.Disruptions in the global financial markets may affect our business plan by adversely impacting the availability and cost of credit.We are dependent on a stable, liquid, and well-functioning financial system to fund our operations and capital investments. In particular, we have historically relied on the public debt markets and bank credit facilities to fund portions of our capital investments and share repurchase program. Our continued access to these markets depends on multiple factors, including the condition of debt capital markets. Disruptions to the global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit. There can be no assurance that various U.S. and world government responses to disruptions in the financial markets will stabilize the markets or increase liquidity or the availability of credit.  A decrease in our credit ratings may increase our cost of credit.A decrease in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cost of credit, financial flexibility and other terms for debt issuances.  We recently announced plans to increase our leverage in the range of $250 to $300 million in the near term.  As a result, one credit rating agency has downgraded our credit rating to non-investment grade, and the Company has been placed on review 8for downgrade at the other credit rating agencies. We do not expect these downgrades to impact our ability to execute our recapitalization plan.The large number of Company-owned restaurants concentrated in Texas, Florida and California makes us susceptible to changes in economic and other trends in those regions.A high concentration of our company-owned restaurants are located in Texas, Florida and California.  As a result, we are particularly susceptible to adverse trends and economic conditions in those states. For example, declining oil prices has caused increased levels of unemployment and other economic pressures that have resulted in lower sales and profits at our restaurants in some oil market regions of Texas and surrounding areas. Negative publicity, local strikes, energy shortages or extreme fluctuations in energy prices, droughts, earthquakes, fires or other natural disasters in regions where our restaurants are highly concentrated could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.Governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants.We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters, including, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status. We have experienced and continue to expect adjustments in payroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for our restaurants in a particular area or across the United States. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. We continue to review the Affordable Care Act and regulations issued related to the law to evaluate the potential impact of this law on our business, and to accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.We are subject to laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We do not expect to incur material costs from compliance with the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring disclosure of calories on the menus, but cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of this portion of the law, which could have adverse effects on our sales or results of operations.Each of our company-owned and our franchisees’ restaurants is also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety, building code and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality where the restaurant is located. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses, permits and approvals that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Although we do not anticipate any material difficulties occurring in the future, we cannot be certain that we, or our franchisees, will not experience material difficulties or failures that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay the opening of restaurants in the future.We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the U.S. and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. This may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an unspecified array of environmental matters. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance. Further, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay, prevent or make cost prohibitive the continuing operations of an existing restaurant or the development of new restaurants in particular locations.We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations which govern the offer and sale of franchises and which may supersede the terms of franchise agreements between us and our franchisees.  Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or retain licenses or approvals to sell franchises could adversely affect us and our franchisees ability to develop new franchise locations.  Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees and joint venture partners. These include antitrust and tax requirements, 9anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse affect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues.Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; animal disease outbreaks (such as the avian flu outbreak in the Midwest U.S. in 2015); or other conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.Inflation may increase our operating expenses. We have experienced impact from inflation. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, or by reviewing, then implementing, alternative products or processes, or other cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.Successful strategic transactions are important to our future growth and profitability.We evaluate potential franchisees of new and existing restaurants and joint venture investments, as well as mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, as part of our strategic planning initiative. These transactions involve various inherent risks, including accurately assessing:•the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisitions, franchise and joint venture partner candidates;•our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; and•unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business or the completion of a divestiture.We acquired Pepper Dining Holding Corp., a franchisee with 103 Chili's restaurants in the Northeast and Southeast U.S. on June 25, 2015.  These acquired restaurants have lower annual average sales volumes and different margin structures than our company-owned Chili's restaurants.  We have integrated the acquired restaurants into our Chili's operations structure and are rolling out processes to improve sales and margins.  We are also reimaging these restaurants and leveraging technology investments in the restaurants.  There is no assurance that these initiatives will achieve the sales growth and margin improvements for which we have planned, and would not adversely impact our profitability in the future if not met.If we are unable to successfully design and execute a business strategy plan, our gross sales and profitability may be adversely affected.Our ability to grow gross sales and increase profitability is dependent on designing and executing effective business strategies. If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees’ ability to:•grow gross sales and increase operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options and high quality service desired by our guests through successful implementation of strategic initiatives;•evolve our marketing and branding strategies in order to appeal to customers, including the success of our integration of our My Chili’s Rewards program with the Plenti rewards program;•innovate and implement technology initiatives that provide a unique digital guest experience;•identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reinvestment in our existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new equipment;10•grow and expand operations, including identifying available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants; and•hire, train and retain qualified managers and team members for existing and new restaurants.Loss of key management personnel could hurt our business and limit our ability to operate and grow successfully.Our success depends, to a significant extent, on our leadership team and other key management personnel. These personnel serve to maintain a corporate vision for our Company, execute our business strategy, and maintain consistency in the operating standards of our restaurants. If we are unable to attract and retain sufficiently experienced and capable management personnel, our business and financial results may suffer.Slow economic growth or a recession could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results.During slow economic growth or a recession, our landlords may be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition, other tenants at retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located or have executed leases, may fail to open or may cease operations. If our landlords fail to satisfy required co-tenancies, this may result in us or our franchisees terminating leases or delaying openings in these locations. Also, decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers in which we are located may affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth.We have a significant percentage of system-wide restaurants owned and operated by our Chili's franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to require our franchisees to maintain brand consistency, the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day oversight of these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control. These risks include franchisee defaults in their obligations to us arising from financial or other difficulties encountered by them, such as payments to us or maintenance and improvements obligations; limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; inability to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; inability to meet rent obligations on leases on which we retain contingent liability; and failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements subjecting us to litigation even when we are not legally liable for a franchisee’s actions or failure to act.Additionally our international franchisees and joint venture partners are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees. These risks include:•difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to U.S. operations;•changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;•challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and•differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, social and political conditions.Our sales volumes generally decrease in winter months in North America.Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally and are generally higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months, which may cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our company-owned or franchised restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness or health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants, including franchised restaurants. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili’s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili’s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili’s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business.There has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms  and similar devices which allow individuals access  to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons.  Many social media platforms immediately publish the content 11their subscribers and participants can post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted.  Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects, or business.  The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.  The dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information's accuracy.Many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social medial platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete.  As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance.  As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests.  We have initiated a multi-year effort to implement new technology platforms that will allow us to digitally engage with our guests and employees and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society.  The initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues, increased employee engagement or brand recognition.  In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information.  The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.Litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance.We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as foodborne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. Our franchise activity also creates a risk of us being named as a joint employer of workers of franchisees for alleged violations of labor and wage laws.  We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.We are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. A security breach or cyber attack could include theft of credit card data or other personal information as well as our intellectual property.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.Failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and teammates and confidential and proprietary information of the company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues and litigation.We receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and team members in our information technology systems, such as point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including our rewards program.  Additionally our systems contain proprietary and confidential information related to our business.  Use of this information is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third party contracts.  If our or our business associates' information systems are compromised as a result of a cyber attack or other external or internal method, or we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in a violation of the laws and regulations, and an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, results of operations and financial condition.  Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us or the imposition 12of penalties.  These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack, failure or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. Like many other retail companies, we experience frequent attempts to compromise our systems, but none have resulted in a material breach.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur additional costs in technology, third party services and personnel to remain in compliance and maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks. Our security frameworks are designed to prevent breaches of our systems and data loss, but these measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.We regard our Chili's® and Maggiano's Little Italy® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts.  We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement.  We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions.  However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons.  Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.  In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant.  Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.     We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.Some business processes are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include certain information technology processes, gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.We perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying values. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.Changes to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets.We make certain estimates and projections with regards to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. The projection of future cash flows used in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.13Identification of material weakness in internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect our financial results.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of  2002. Those provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. If such a material weakness is identified, it could indicate a lack of adequate controls to generate accurate financial statements. We routinely assess our internal control over financial reporting, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting team members, especially in light of the increased demand for such individuals among publicly traded companies.We may not be able to achieve our target for growth in total return to shareholders.We define our total returns as earnings per share plus our dividend yield.  Comparable restaurant sales that are below our target, slowing growth of our concepts domestically, a decline in growth of our international business, any event that substantially increases our operating costs or any event that decreases our cash flow and ability to repurchase our stock or pay dividends as expected could negatively affect our stock price, result in lower than targeted EPS growth and reduce total returns to shareholders.Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending, consumer confidence, and operating costs, include, without limitation, changes in financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates); increases in costs of food commodities; increases in fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increases in utility and energy costs on regional or national levels; increases in health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events; changes in consumer behaviors; changes in demographic trends; labor shortages and availability of employees; union organization; strikes; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms) and other acts of God"
3,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2015-08-24,"RISK FACTORS.We wish to caution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below are important because they could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases, written or electronic communications, and verbal statements by our representatives.You should be aware that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause our or our industry’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words like “believes,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “expects,” and other similar expressions that convey uncertainty about future events or outcomes. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Risks Related to Our BusinessCompetition may adversely affect our operations and financial results.The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, nutritional and dietary trends and food quality, and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, economic conditions, population and traffic patterns. We compete 7within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains, some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longer operating histories than ours. The U.S. total employment market is growing, and there is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. We continue to face competition as a result of several factors, including quick service and fast casual restaurants also offering high quality food and beverage choices and the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs.Our restaurants also face competition from the introduction of new products and menu items by competitors, as well as substantial price discounting among other offers, and are likely to continue to face such future competition in light of the slow paced economic growth. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict and will be influenced by competitive product offerings, pricing and promotions offered by competitors. Our ability to differentiate our brands from their competitors, which is in part limited by the advertising spend available to us and by consumer perception, cannot be assured. These factors could reduce the gross sales or profitability at our restaurants, which would decrease revenues or profitability generated by company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchisees.Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The foodservice industry as a whole rests on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels, including the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet, nutrition, health and health insurance. We and our franchisees depend on the sustained demand for our products, which may be affected by factors outside of our control. Changes in nutritional or health insurance guidelines issued by federal or local government agencies, issuance of similar guidelines or statistical information by other federal, state or local municipalities, academic studies, or advocacy organizations, among other things, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.The slow global economic growth continues to impact consumer discretionary spending and a continued and prolonged slow trend in growth could result in declines in consumer discretionary spending materially affecting our financial performance in the future.The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending. Despite improvement in total employment and consumer confidence in the U.S., consumer incomes have been slow to recover and discretionary income for restaurant visits has been challenged.  Economic improvement in the restaurant industry continues to come from cost savings initiatives as well as our success to improve the guest experience within our existing restaurant locations. If this current slow economic growth continues for a prolonged period of time and/or deepens in magnitude returning to the negative trends of the prior years, our business, results of operations and ability to comply with the covenants under our credit facility could be materially affected. Deterioration in guest traffic and/or a reduction in the average amount guests spend in our restaurants will negatively impact our revenues. This will also result in lower royalties collected, sales deleverage, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. This could result in further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures.Future slow global economic growth or recessionary effects on us are unknown at this time and could have a potential material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. There is no assurance that any governmental plan to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will foster growth in consumer confidence, stabilize the financial markets, increase liquidity and the availability of credit, or result in lower unemployment.Inflation may increase our operating expenses.We have experienced impact from inflation. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, or by reviewing, then implementing, alternative products or processes, or other cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.8Changes in governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants.We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters, including, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status. We have experienced and continue to expect adjustments in payroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage; we cannot be certain there will be no additional significant increases in the future. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for our restaurants in a particular area or across the United States. Other labor shortages or increased team member turnover could also increase labor costs. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. We continue to review the Affordable Care Act and regulations issued related to the law to evaluate the potential impact of this law on our business, and to accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.We are subject to laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We do not expect to incur material costs from compliance with the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring disclosure of calories on the menus, but cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of this portion of the law, which could have adverse effects on our sales or results of operations.Each of our company-owned and our franchisees’ restaurants is also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality where the restaurant is located. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and approvals that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Although we do not, at this time, anticipate any occurring in the future, we cannot be certain that we, or our franchisees, will not experience material difficulties or failures that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay the opening of restaurants in the future.We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative affect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the U.S. and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. This may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an unspecified array of environmental matters. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance. Further, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay, prevent or make cost prohibitive the continuing operations of an existing restaurant or the development of new restaurants in particular locations.Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees and joint venture partners. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse affect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues.Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; animal disease outbreaks (such as the avian 9flu outbreak in the midwestern U.S. in 2015); or other conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.Our profitability may be adversely affected by increases in energy costs.Our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs, in particular, electricity and natural gas. Various regions of the United States in which we operate multiple restaurants have experienced volatility in utility prices. This has affected costs in the past and if they occur again, it would have possible adverse effects on our profitability to the extent not otherwise recoverable through price increases or alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. Further, higher prices for petroleum-based fuels may be passed on to us by suppliers putting further pressure on margins as well as impact our guests discretionary funds and ability to patron our restaurants or their menu choices.Successful strategic transactions are important to our future growth and profitability.We evaluate potential franchisees of new and existing restaurants and joint venture investments, as well as mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, as part of our strategic planning initiative. These transactions involve various inherent risks, including accurately assessing:•the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of franchise and joint venture partner candidates;•our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; and•unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business or the completion of a divestiture.We acquired Pepper Dining Holding Corp., a franchisee with 103 Chili's restaurants in the northeastern and southeastern U.S. on June 25, 2015.  These acquired restaurants have lower annual average sales volumes and different margin structures than our company-owned Chili's restaurants.  We are integrating the acquired restaurants into our Chili's operations structure and are rolling out processes to improve sales and margins.  We are also reimaging these restaurants and leveraging technology investments in the restaurants.  There is no assurance that these initiatives will achieve the sales growth and margin improvements for which we have planned, and would not adversely impact our profitability in the future if not met.If we are unable to meet our business strategy plan, our profitability in the future may be adversely affected.Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees’ ability to:•increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options and high quality service desired by our guests through successful implementation of strategic initiatives;•identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reimaging of existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new equipment;•identify available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants;•obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis;•hire all necessary contractors and subcontractors, obtain construction materials at suitable prices, and maintain construction schedules; and•hire and train or retain qualified managers and team members for existing and new restaurants.The current slow economic growth could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results.If the slow economic growth continues or returns to prior recessionary levels, our landlords may be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition, other tenants at retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located or have executed leases, may fail to open or may cease operations. If our landlords fail to satisfy required co-tenancies, this may result in us or our franchisees terminating leases or delaying openings in these locations. Also, decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers in which we are located may affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations.The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth.We have a significant percentage of system-wide restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to maintain brand consistency, the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day oversight of these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control. These risks include 10franchisee defaults in their obligations to us arising from financial or other difficulties encountered by them, such as payments to us or maintenance and improvements obligations; limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; inability to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; inability to meet rent obligations on leases on which we retain contingent liability; and failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements subjecting us to litigation even when we are not legally liable for a franchisee’s actions or failure to act.Additionally our international franchisees and joint venture partners are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees. These risks include:•difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to U.S. operations;•changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;•challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and•differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, cultural, social and political conditions.Our sales volumes generally decrease in winter months in North America.Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally and are generally higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months, which may cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness or health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili’s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili’s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili’s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication, including social media. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.Our inability or failure to recognize, respond to and effectively manage the accelerated impact of social media could materially adversely impact our business.There has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms  and similar devices which allow individuals access  to a broad audience of consumers and other interested persons.  Many social media platforms immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants can post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted.  Information posted on such platforms at any time may be adverse to our interests or may be inaccurate, each of which may harm our performance, prospects, or business.  The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction.  The dissemination of information online could harm our business, prospects, financial condition, and results of operations, regardless of the information's accuracy.Many of our competitors are expanding their use of social media and new social medial platforms are rapidly being developed, potentially making more traditional social media platforms obsolete.  As a result, we need to continuously innovate and develop our social media strategies in order to maintain broad appeal with guests and brand relevance.  As part of our marketing efforts, we rely on search engine marketing and social media platforms to attract and retain guests.  We have initiated a multi-year effort to implement new technology platforms that will allow us to digitally engage with our guests and employees and strengthen our marketing and analytics capabilities in this increasingly connected society.  The initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues, increased employee engagement or brand recognition.  In addition, a variety of risks are associated with the use of social media, including the improper disclosure of proprietary information, negative comments about us, exposure of personally identifiable information, fraud, or out-of-date information.  The inappropriate use of social media vehicles by our guests or employees could increase our costs, lead to litigation or result in negative publicity that could damage our reputation.Litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance.We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. 11Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.We are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. A security breach or cyber attack could include theft of credit card data or other personal information as well as our intellectual property.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.Failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and teammates and confidential and proprietary information of the company could damage our reputation and expose us to loss of revenues and litigation.We receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and team members in our information technology systems, such as point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, including our rewards program.  Additionally our systems contain proprietary and confidential information related to our business.  Use of this information is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third party contracts.  If our or our business associates' information systems are compromised as a result of a cyber attack or other external or internal method, or we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, it could result in a violation of the laws and regulations, and an adverse and material impact on our reputation, operations, results of operations and financial condition.  Such security breaches could also result in litigation or governmental investigation against us or the imposition of penalties.  These impacts could also occur if we are perceived either to have had an attack, failure or to have failed to properly respond to an incident. Like many other retail companies, we experience frequent attempts to compromise our systems but none have resulted in a material breach.  As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to data, we may incur additional costs in technology, third party services and personnel to remain in compliance and maintain systems designed to anticipate and prevent cyber attacks. Our security frameworks prevent breaches of our systems and data loss, but these measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss.Failure to protect our service marks or other intellectual property could harm our business.We regard our Chili's® and Maggiano's® service marks, and other service marks and trademarks related to our restaurant businesses, as having significant value and being important to our marketing efforts.  We rely on a combination of protections provided by contracts, copyrights, patents, trademarks, service marks and other common law rights, such as trade secret and unfair competition laws, to protect our restaurants and services from infringement.  We have registered certain trademarks and service marks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions.  However, we are aware of names and marks identical or similar to our service marks being used from time to time by other persons.  Although our policy is to oppose any such infringement, further or unknown unauthorized uses or other misappropriation of our trademarks or service marks could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect our business.  In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we have or intend to open or franchise a restaurant.  Although we believe we have taken appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property, there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate, and defending or enforcing our service marks and other intellectual property could result in the expenditure of significant resources.     We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.Some business processes are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include certain information technology processes, gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain 12payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities and adequate security frameworks to guard against breaches or data loss; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.Disruptions in the global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit and consumer spending patterns.Previous disruptions to the global financial markets and continuing slow economic recovery have adversely impacted the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future.  The disruptions in the financial markets also had an adverse effect on the U.S. and world economy, which has negatively impacted consumer spending patterns.  There can be no assurance that various U.S. and world government present and future responses to the previous disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity or the availability of credit.    Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.We perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.Changes to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets.We make certain estimates and projections with regards to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value. The projection of future cash flows used in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.Identification of material weakness in internal control over financial reporting may adversely affect our financial results.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Those provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. If such a material weakness is identified, it could indicate a lack of adequate controls to generate accurate financial statements. We routinely assess our internal control over financial reporting, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting team members, especially in light of the increased demand for such individuals among publicly traded companies.Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes in economic conditions and financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates and costs for consumers and reduced disposable income); credit availability; increased costs of food commodities; increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events; consumer perceptions of food safety; changes in consumer tastes and behaviors; governmental monetary policies; changes in demographic trends; availability of employees; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms) and other acts of God.13"
13,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2014-08-25,"RISK FACTORS.We wish to caution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below are important because they could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases, written or electronic communications, and verbal statements by our representatives.You should be aware that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause our or our industry’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words like “believes,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “expects,” and other similar expressions that convey uncertainty about future events or outcomes. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Risks Related to Our BusinessCompetition may adversely affect our operations and financial results.The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, nutritional and dietary trends and food quality, and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, economic conditions, population and traffic patterns. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains, some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longer operating histories than ours. Despite a slowly rebounding U.S. employment market, there is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. We continue to face competition as a result of several factors, including quick service and fast casual restaurants also offering high quality food and beverage offerings, the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, including the grocery industry offering of convenient meals in the form of improved entrees and side dishes. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu 7items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs.Our restaurants also face competition from the introduction of new products and menu items by competitors, as well as substantial price discounting among other offers, and are likely to continue to face such future competition in light of the slow paced economic recovery. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict and will be influenced by competitive product offerings, pricing and promotions offered by competitors. Our ability to differentiate our brands from their competitors, which is in part limited by the advertising spend available to us and by consumer perception, cannot be assured. These factors could reduce the gross sales or profitability at our restaurants, which would decrease revenues generated by company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchisees.Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The foodservice industry as a whole rests on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels, including the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet, nutrition, health and health insurance. We and our franchisees depend on the sustained demand for our products, which may be affected by factors outside of our control. Changes in nutritional or health insurance guidelines issued by federal or local government agencies, issuance of similar guidelines or statistical information by other federal, state or local municipalities, academic studies, or advocacy organizations among other things, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.The slow global economic recovery continues to impact consumer discretionary spending and a continued and prolonged economic recovery could result in declines in consumer discretionary spending materially affecting our financial performance in the future.The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending. Consumer confidence has not fully recovered from prior lows impacting the public’s ability and/or desire to spend discretionary dollars as a result of significantly limited job availability, slow recovering home values, limited investment gains in the financial markets and continued reduced access to credit.  Economic headwinds were encountered in fiscal 2014, including increased personal income taxes and payroll taxes.  Economic improvement in the restaurant industry continues to come from cost savings initiatives as well as our success to improve the guest experience within our existing restaurant locations. If this current slow economic recovery continues for a prolonged period of time and/or deepens in magnitude returning to the negative trends of the prior years, our business, results of operations and ability to comply with the covenants under our credit facility could be materially affected. Leading economic indicators such as employment and consumer confidence remain challenged and are only showing meaningful improvement towards the end of fiscal 2014. Deterioration in guest traffic and/or a reduction in the average amount guests spend in our restaurants will negatively impact our revenues. This will also result in lower royalties collected, sales deleverage, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. The result could be further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures.Future slow global economic recovery or recessionary effects on us are unknown at this time and could have a potential material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. There is no assurance that the government’s plan to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will foster growth in consumer confidence, stabilize the financial markets, increase liquidity and the availability of credit, or result in lower unemployment.The current slow economic recovery could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results.If the slow economic recovery continues or returns to recessionary levels, our landlords may be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition, other tenants at retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located or have executed leases, may fail to open or may cease operations. If our landlords fail to satisfy required co-tenancies, this may result in us or our franchisees terminating leases or delaying openings in these locations. Also, decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers in which we are located may affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations.Inflation may increase our operating expenses.We have experienced impact from inflation. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu prices, 8or by reviewing, then implementing, alternative products or processes, or other cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.Changes in governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants.We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters, including, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status. We have experienced and continue to expect adjustments in payroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage; we cannot be certain there will be no additional significant increases in the future. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for our restaurants in a particular area or across the United States. Other labor shortages or increased team member turnover could also increase labor costs. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. We continue to review the Affordable Care Act and regulations issued related to the law to evaluate the potential impact of this law on our business, and to accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.We are subject to laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We do not expect to incur material costs from compliance with the provision of the Affordable Care Act requiring disclosure of calories on the menus, but cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of this portion of the law, which could have adverse effects on our sales or results of operations.Each of our company-owned and our franchisees’ restaurants is also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality where the restaurant is located. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and approvals that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Although we do not, at this time, anticipate any occurring in the future, we cannot be certain that we, or our franchisees, will not experience material difficulties or failures that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay the opening of restaurants in the future.We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative affect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the U.S. and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. This may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as-yet-unspecified array of environmental matters. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance. Further, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay, prevent or make cost prohibitive the continuing operations of an existing restaurant or the development of new restaurants in particular locations.Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees and joint venture partners. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse affect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.9Our profitability may be adversely affected by increases in energy costs.Our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs, in particular, electricity and natural gas. Various regions of the United States in which we operate multiple restaurants have experienced volatility in utility prices. This has affected costs in the past and if they occur again, it would have possible adverse effects on our profitability to the extent not otherwise recoverable through price increases or alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. Further, higher prices for petroleum-based fuels may be passed on to us by suppliers putting further pressure on margins as well as impact our guests discretionary funds and ability to patron our restaurants or their  menu choices.Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues.Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tight credit market; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; or other conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.Successful strategic transactions are important to our future growth and profitability.We evaluate potential franchisees of new and existing restaurants and joint venture investments, as well as mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, as part of our strategic planning initiative. These transactions involve various inherent risks, including accurately assessing:•the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of franchise and joint venture partner candidates;•our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; and•unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business or the completion of a divestiture.If we are unable to meet our business strategy plan, our profitability in the future may be adversely affected.Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees’ ability to:•increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options and high quality service desired by our guests through successful implementation of strategic initiatives;•identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including reimaging of existing restaurants, new restaurant development and new equipment;•identify available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants;•obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis;•hire all necessary contractors and subcontractors, obtain construction materials at suitable prices, and maintain construction schedules; and•hire and train or retain qualified managers and team members for existing and new restaurants.The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth.We have a significant percentage of system-wide restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to maintain brand consistency, the franchise relationship reduces our direct day-to-day control over these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control of same. These risks include franchisee defaults in their obligations to us arising from financial or other difficulties encountered by them, such as payments to us or maintenance and improvements obligations; limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; inability to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; inability to meet rent obligations on leases on which we retain contingent liability; and failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements subjecting us to litigation even when we are not legally liable for a franchisee’s actions or failure to act.Additionally our international franchisees and joint venture partners are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees. These risks include:•difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to U.S. operations;•changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;•challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and•differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, social and political conditions.10Our sales volumes generally decrease in winter months in North America.Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally and are generally higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months, which may cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness or health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili’s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili’s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili’s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication, including social media. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.Litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance.We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.We are dependent on information technology and any material failure in the operation or security of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. A security breach or cyber attack could include theft of credit card data or other personal information as well as our intellectual property.  Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.Failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and teammates could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation.We receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and teammates. The use of this information by us is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third party contracts. If we or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations or our information systems are compromised as a result of a cyber attack or any other failure it could adversely and materially affect our reputation, as well as operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change or cyber risks evolve pertaining to this data, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance.11We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.Some business processes are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.Disruptions in the global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit and consumer spending patterns.Previous disruptions to the global financial markets and continuing slow economic recovery have adversely impacted the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future.  The disruptions in the financial markets also had an adverse effect on the U.S. and world economy, which has negatively impacted consumer spending patterns.  There can be no assurance that various U.S. and world government present and future responses to the previous disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity or the availability of credit.    Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.We perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.Changes to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets.We make certain estimates and projections with regards to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value or discounted future cash flows of the asset. The projection of future cash flows used in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected.Identification of material weakness in internal control may adversely affect our financial results.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Those provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control. If such a material weakness is identified, it could indicate a lack of adequate controls to generate accurate financial statements. We routinely assess our internal controls, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting team members, especially in light of the increased demand for such individuals among publicly traded companies.Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes in economic conditions and financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates and costs for consumers and reduced disposable income); credit availability; increased costs of food commodities; increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events; consumer perceptions of food safety; changes in consumer tastes and behaviors; governmental monetary policies; changes in demographic 12trends; availability of employees; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms) and other acts of God"
9,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2013-08-26,"RISK FACTORS.We wish to caution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below are important because they could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this report, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases, written or electronic communications, and verbal statements by our representatives.You should be aware that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause our or our industry’s actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words like “believes,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “predicts,” “expects,” and other similar expressions that convey uncertainty about future events or outcomes. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.Risks Related to Our BusinessCompetition may adversely affect our operations and financial results.The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, nutritional and dietary trends and food quality, and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, economic conditions, population and traffic patterns. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains, some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longer operating histories than ours. Despite a weak U.S. employment market, there is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. We continue to face competition as a result of several factors, including quick service and fast casual restaurants also offering high quality food and beverage offerings, the convergence in grocery, deli and restaurant services, including the grocery industry offering of convenient meals in the form of improved entrees and side dishes. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs.Our restaurants also face competition from the introduction of new products and menu items by competitors, as well as substantial price discounting among other offers, and are likely to continue to face such future competition in light of the slow 7paced economic recovery. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict and will be influenced by competitive product offerings, pricing and promotions offered by competitors. Our ability to differentiate our brands from their competitors, which is in part limited by the advertising spend available to us and by consumer perception, cannot be assured. These factors could reduce the gross sales or profitability at our restaurants, which would decrease revenues generated by company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchisees.Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The foodservice industry as a whole rests on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels, including the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet, nutrition, health and health insurance. We and our franchisees depend on the sustained demand for our products, which may be affected by factors outside of our control. Changes in nutritional or health insurance guidelines issued by federal or local government agencies, issuance of similar guidelines or statistical information by other federal, state or local municipalities, academic studies, or advocacy organizations among other things, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our company-owned restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.The weak global economic recovery continues to impact consumer discretionary spending and a prolonged economic recovery could result in declines in consumer discretionary spending materially affecting our financial performance in the future.The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending. Consumer confidence has not fully recovered from recent lows impacting the public’s ability and/or desire to spend discretionary dollars as a result of significantly limited job availability, slow recovering home values, limited investment gains in the financial markets and continued reduced access to credit. Current international fiscal concerns continue to impact the slow U.S. economic recovery. While sales and traffic gains were made by the restaurant industry and our brands in the prior fiscal year, economic headwinds were encountered in fiscal 2013, including increased personal income taxes and payroll taxes.  Economic improvement in the restaurant industry continues to come from cost savings initiatives as well as our success to improve the guest experience within our existing restaurant locations. If this current slow economic recovery continues for a prolonged period of time and/or deepens in magnitude returning to the negative trends of the prior years, our business, results of operations and ability to comply with the covenants under our credit facility could be materially affected. Leading economic indicators such as employment and consumer confidence remain challenged and did not show meaningful improvement in fiscal 2013. Deterioration in guest traffic and/or a reduction in the average amount guests spend in our restaurants will negatively impact our revenues. This will also result in lower royalties collected, sales deleverage, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and in turn, cause downward pressure on our profitability. The result could be further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures.Future slower global economic recovery or recessionary effects on us are unknown at this time and could have a potential material adverse affect on our financial position and results of operations. There is no assurance that the government’s plan to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will revive consumer confidence, stabilize the financial markets, increase liquidity and the availability of credit, or result in lower unemployment, which continues to remain stubbornly high at the present time.The current slow economic recovery could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results.If the slow economic recovery continues or returns to recessionary levels, our landlords may be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition, other tenants at retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located or have executed leases, may fail to open or may cease operations. If our landlords fail to satisfy required co-tenancies, this may result in us or our franchisees terminating leases or delaying openings in these locations. Also, decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers in which we are located may affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations.Inflation may increase our operating expenses.We have experienced impact from inflation. Inflation has caused added food, labor and benefits costs and increased our operating expenses. As operating expenses rise, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover costs by raising menu 8prices, or by reviewing, then implementing, alternative products or processes, or other cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.Changes in governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants.We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters, including, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status. We expect adjustments in payroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage, and although such increases are not expected to be material, we cannot be certain there will be no material increases in the future. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for our restaurants in a particular area or across the United States. Other labor shortages or increased team member turnover could also increase labor costs. In addition, our suppliers may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. We continue to review the health care reform law enacted by Congress in March of 2010 and regulations issued related to the law to evaluate the potential impact of this new law on our business, and to accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.We are subject to laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We do not expect to incur material costs from compliance with the provision of the new health care law requiring disclosure of calories on the menus, but cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of this portion of the law, which could have adverse effects on our sales or results of operations.Each of our company-owned and our franchisees’ restaurants is also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality where the restaurant is located. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and approvals that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Although we do not, at this time, anticipate any occurring in the future, we cannot be certain that we, or our franchisees, will not experience material difficulties or failures that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay the opening of restaurants in the future.We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative affect on our operations, we cannot ensure this will not occur in the future. In particular, the U.S. and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. This may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as-yet-unspecified array of environmental matters. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance. Further, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay, prevent or make cost prohibitive the continuing operations of an existing restaurant or the development of new restaurants in particular locations.Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world impacting the way we do business with our international franchisees and joint venture partners. These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legal requirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse affect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings.9Our profitability may be adversely affected by increases in energy costs.Our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs, in particular, electricity and natural gas. Various regions of the United States in which we operate multiple restaurants have experienced volatility in utility prices. This has affected costs in the past and if they occur again, it would have possible adverse effects on our profitability to the extent not otherwise recoverable through price increases or alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. Further, higher prices for petroleum-based fuels may be passed on to us by suppliers putting further pressure on margins as well as impact our guests discretionary funds and ability to patron our restaurants or their  menu choices.Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other products may increase costs or reduce revenues.Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other products to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes; the inability of our suppliers to obtain credit in a tightened credit market; food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements; or other conditions beyond our control, could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.Successful strategic transactions are important to our future growth and profitability.We evaluate potential franchisees of new and existing restaurants and joint venture investments, as well as mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, as part of our strategic planning initiative. These transactions involve various inherent risks, including accurately assessing:•the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of franchise and joint venture partner candidates;•our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; and•unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business or the completion of a divestiture.If we are unable to meet our business strategy plan, our profitability in the future may be adversely affected.Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees’ ability to:•increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options and high quality service desired by our guests through successful implementation of strategic initiatives;•identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including remodeling of existing restaurants and new restaurant development;•identify available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants;•obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis;•hire all necessary contractors and subcontractors, obtain construction materials at suitable prices, and maintain construction schedules; and•hire and train or retain qualified managers and team members for existing and new restaurants.The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth.We have significantly increased the percentage of restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to maintain brand consistency, this increase reduces our direct day-to-day control over these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control of same. These risks include franchisee defaults in their obligations to us arising from financial or other difficulties encountered by them, such as payments to us or maintenance and improvements obligations; limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; inability to participate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; inability to meet rent obligations on leases on which we retain contingent liability; and failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements subjecting us to litigation even when we are not legally liable for a franchisee’s actions or failure to act.10Additionally our international franchisees and joint venture partners are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees. These risks include:•difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to U.S. operations;•changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;•challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and•differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, social and political conditions.Our sales volumes generally decrease in winter months in North America.Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally and are generally higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months, which may cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness or health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chili’s brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chili’s restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chili’s brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can be disseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication, including social media. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materially impact our financial performance.Litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance.We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business. These matters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment, disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from these claims, regardless of their validity. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.We are dependent on information technology and any material failure of that technology or our ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarily at our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recovery of electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recovery plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in required reporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposure to administrative and other legal claims.11We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs.Some business processes are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.Disruptions in the global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit and consumer spending patterns.The disruptions to the global financial markets and continuing slow economic recovery have adversely impacted the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future.  The disruptions in the financial markets also had an adverse effect on the U.S. and world economy, which has negatively impacted consumer spending patterns.  There can be no assurance that various U.S. and world government present and future responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity or the availability of credit.    Failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and teammates could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation.We receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and teammates. The use of this information by us is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third party contracts. If our security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure it remains in compliance.Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.We perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.Changes to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets.We make certain estimates and projections with regards to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value or undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. The projection of future cash flows used in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our results of operations could be adversely affected.Identification of material weakness in internal control may adversely affect our financial results.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Those provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control. If such a material weakness is identified, it could indicate a lack of adequate controls to generate accurate financial statements. We routinely assess our internal controls, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting team members, especially in light of the increased demand for such individuals among publicly traded companies.12Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes in economic conditions and financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates and costs for consumers and reduced disposable income); credit availability; increased costs of food commodities; increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events; consumer perceptions of food safety; changes in consumer tastes and behaviors; governmental monetary policies; changes in demographic trends; availability of employees; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms) and other acts of God"
4,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2012-08-27,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS.  We wish tocaution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from those projectedin forward-looking statements contained in this report, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases, written or electronic communications, and verbal statements by our representatives. You should be aware that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause our or ourindustrys actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generallyaccompanied by words like believes, anticipates, estimates, predicts, expects, and other similar expressions that convey uncertainty about future events or outcomes. We expressly disclaimany obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Risks Related to Our Business Competition may adversely affect our operations and financial results.  The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, nutritional and dietary trends and food quality, and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, economicconditions, population and traffic patterns. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains, some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longeroperating histories than ours. Despite a weak U.S. employment market, there is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. We continue to face competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deliand restaurant services, including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals in the form of improved entrees and side dishes, as well as the trend in quick service and fast  casual restaurants toward higher quality food and beverage offerings. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, theattractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs.   8 Our restaurants also face competition from the introduction of new products and menu itemsby competitors, as well as substantial price discounting and other offers, and are likely to continue to face such competition in the future. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the future success of new products, initiativesand overall strategies is highly difficult to predict and will be influenced by competitive product offerings, pricing and promotions offered by competitors. Our ability to differentiate our brands from their competitors, which is in part limited bythe advertising monies available to us and by consumer perception, cannot be assured. These factors could reduce the gross sales or profitability at our restaurants, which would reduce the revenues generated by company-owned restaurants and royaltypayments from franchisees.  Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor ofalternative foods. The food service industry as a whole rests on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels, and the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet,nutrition and health. We and our franchisees depend on the sustained demand for our products, which may be affected by factors we do not control. Changes in nutritional guidelines issued by the federal government agencies, issuance of similarguidelines or statistical information by other federal, state or local municipalities, academic studies, or advocacy organizations among other things, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offeredby our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our company-owned restaurants and the paymentswe receive from franchisees.  The global economic crisis continues to impact consumer discretionary spending and a prolonged economicrecovery could result in declines in consumer discretionary spending materially affecting our financial performance in the future.  The restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending. Consumer confidence has not recovered from historic lows impacting the publics ability and/or desire to spenddiscretionary dollars as a result of job losses, home foreclosures, significantly reduced home values, investment losses in the financial markets, personal bankruptcies and reduced access to credit. Current international fiscal concernsthreaten to weaken the slow U.S. economic recovery. While sales and traffic gains have been made by the restaurant industry and our restaurants in fiscal 2012, the economic improvement in the restaurant industry continues to come from cost savingsinitiatives as well as our success to improve our guest experience within our existing restaurant locations. If this current weak economic recovery continues for a prolonged period of time and/or deepens in magnitude returning to the negative trendsof the prior years, our business, results of operations and ability to comply with the covenants under our credit facility could be materially affected. Leading economic indicators such as employment and consumer confidence remain challengedand may not show meaningful improvement in fiscal 2013. Deterioration in guest traffic and/or a reduction in the average amount guests spend in our restaurants will negatively impact our revenues. This will result in lower royalties collected,sales deleverage, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and will, in turn cause downward pressure on our profitability. The result could be further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurantclosures. Future weak global economic results or recessionary effects on us are unknown at this time and could have apotential material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the governments plan to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will restore consumerconfidence, stabilize the financial markets, increase liquidity and the availability of credit, or result in lower unemployment, which remains stubbornly high at the present time.  The current weak economic recovery could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located, which in turn could negativelyaffect our financial results.  If the weak economic recovery continues or returns to recessionary levels, our landlords maybe unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition other tenants at retail  9 centers in which we or our franchisees are located or have executed leases may fail to open or may cease operations. If our landlords fail to satisfy required co-tenancies, such failures mayresult in us or our franchisees terminating leases or delaying openings in these locations. Also, decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers in which we are located may affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of thesefactors could have a material adverse impact on our operations.  Inflation may increase our operating expenses. We have experienced impact from inflation. Inflation has caused increased food, labor and benefits costs and has increased our operatingexpenses. As operating expenses increase, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover increased costs by increasing menu prices, or by reviewing, then implementing, alternative products or processes, or by implementing other cost reductionprocedures. We cannot ensure, however, that we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.  Changes in governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants. We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), alongwith the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governmental authoritiesthat govern these and other employment matters, including, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status. We expect increases in payroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage, andalthough such increases are not expected to be material, we cannot assure you that there will not be material increases in the future. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labororganizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for our restaurants in a particular area or across the United States. Other labor shortages or increased team member turnover could also increase labor costs. In addition, ourvendors may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. We continue to review the health care reform law enacted by Congress in March of 2010 andregulations issued related to the law to evaluate the potential impact of this new law on our business, and to accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and priceincreases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.  We are subject to laws and regulations, which varyfrom jurisdiction to jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposureto governmental investigations or litigation. We do not expect to incur material costs from compliance with the provision of the new health care law requiring disclosure of calories on the menus, but cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guestbehavior resulting from implementation of this portion of the law, which could have adverse effects on our sales or results of operations.  Each of our and our franchisees restaurants is also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health, sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state, county and/ormunicipality where the restaurant is located. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and approvals that could impact the continuing operations of an existingrestaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Although we do not, at this time, anticipate any occurring in the future, we cannot assure you that we or our franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures thatcould impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay the opening of restaurants in the future.  We arealso subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on our operations, we cannot ensure that there will not be a material negative effect in the future. In particular, the U.S. andother foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters   10 such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters.These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/ornecessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance. Further, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors coulddelay, prevent or make cost prohibitive the continuing operations of an existing restaurant or the development of new restaurants in particular locations.  Due to our international franchising, we are also subject to governmental regulations throughout the world that impact the way we do business with our international franchisees and joint venture partners.These include antitrust and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, import/export/customs regulations and other international trade regulations, the USA Patriot Act and The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure to comply with any such legalrequirements could subject us to monetary liabilities and other sanctions, which could adversely impact our business and financial performance.  The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future lawsand regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure tocomply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliancewith these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. Our profitability may be adversely affected by increases in energy costs.  Our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs, in particular electricity and natural gas. Various regions of the United States in which we operate multiple restaurantshave experienced in the recent past significant increases in utility prices. These increases have affected costs and if they occur again, it would have possible adverse effects on our profitability to the extent not otherwise recoverable throughprice increases or alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. Further, higher prices for petroleum-based fuels may be passed on to us by vendors putting further pressure on margins as well as impact our guests discretionary fundsand ability to patron our restaurants or guests menu choices.  Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of foodand other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues.  Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food itemsand other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market, food safety warnings or advisories or theprospect of such pronouncements, or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk couldincrease our costs and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.  Successful strategic transactions areimportant to our future growth and profitability.  We evaluate potential franchisees of new and existing restaurants andjoint venture investments, as well as mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, as part of our strategic planning initiative. These transactions involve various inherent risks, including accurately assessing:     the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of franchise and joint venturepartner candidates;   11    our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; and     unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business or the completion of a divestiture. If we are unable to meet our business strategy plan, our profitability in the future may be adversely affected. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchiseesability to:      increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options and high quality service desired by our gueststhrough successful implementation of strategic initiatives;      identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including remodeling of existing restaurants and new restaurantdevelopment;      identify available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants;     obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis;     hire all necessary contractors and subcontractors, obtain construction materials at suitable prices, and maintain construction schedules; and     hire and train or retain qualified managers and team members for existing and new restaurants. The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth.  We have significantly increased the percentage of restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to maintain brand consistency, this increase reduces ourdirect day-to-day control over these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control of same. These risks include franchisee defaults in their obligations to us arising from financial or otherdifficulties encountered by them, such as payments to us or maintenance and improvements obligations; limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; inability to participate in business strategychanges due to financial constraints; inability to meet rent obligations on leases on which we retain contingent liability; and failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements subjecting us to litigation even when we are not legallyliable for a franchisees actions or failure to act.  Additionally our international franchisees and joint venturepartners are subject to risks not encountered by our domestic franchisees. These risks include:      difficulties in achieving consistency of product quality and service as compared to U.S. operations;     changes to recipes and menu offerings to meet cultural norms;     challenges to obtain adequate and reliable supplies necessary to provide menu items and maintain food quality; and     differences, changes or uncertainties in economic, regulatory, legal, social and political conditions. Our sales volumes generally decrease in winter months in North America.  Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally and are generally higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months, which may cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.   12 Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint publicperception of the brand.  Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor foodquality, illness or health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chilis brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one ormore Chilis restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chilis brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The speed at which negative publicity (whether or not accurate) can bedisseminated has increased dramatically with the capabilities of electronic communication, including social media. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such reports, we may suffer declines in guest traffic which could materiallyimpact our financial performance.  Litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business and our financial performance. We are subject to lawsuits, administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the regular course of business. Thesematters typically involve claims by guests, team members and others regarding issues such as food borne illness, food safety, premises liability, compliance with wage and hour requirements, work-related injuries, discrimination, harassment,disability and other operational issues common to the foodservice industry, as well as contract disputes and intellectual property infringement matters. We could be adversely affected by negative publicity and litigation costs resulting from theseclaims, regardless of their validity. Significant legal fees and costs in complex class action litigation or an adverse judgment or settlement that is not insured or is in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on ourfinancial position and results of operations.  We are dependent on information technology and any material failure of that technology orour ability to execute a comprehensive business continuity plan could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.  We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations andvarious other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgradingor transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems. Additionally, our corporate systems and processes and corporate support for our restaurant operations are handled primarilyat our restaurant support center. We have disaster recovery procedures and business continuity plans in place to address most events of a crisis nature, including tornadoes and other natural disasters, and back up and off-site locations for recoveryof electronic and other forms of data and information. However, if we are unable to fully implement our disaster recover plans, we may experience delays in recovery of data, inability to perform vital corporate functions, tardiness in requiredreporting and compliance, failures to adequately support field operations and other breakdowns in normal communication and operating procedures that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and exposureto administrative and other legal claims.  We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks,including disruptions in business and increased costs.  Some business processes are currently outsourced to third parties.Such processes include gift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our otherbusiness processes   13 to determine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internalcontrol practices, such as redundant processing facilities; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financialcondition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting.  Continuing disruptions in the global financial markets mayadversely impact the availability and cost of credit and consumer spending patterns.  The continuing disruptions to theglobal financial markets and continuing weak economic recovery has adversely impacted the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future. The disruptions in the financial markets also had an adverseeffect on the U.S. and world economy, which has negatively impacted consumer spending patterns. There can be no assurance that various U.S. and world government present and future responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restoreconsumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity or the availability of credit.  Declines in the market price of our commonstock or changes in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.  We perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests thatwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, orin the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge torecognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected. Changes to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certainrestaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets.  We make certain estimates andprojections with regards to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance in connection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds theestimated fair value or undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. The projection of future cash flows used in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual resultsdiffer from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. If impairment charges are significant, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and teammates could expose us to litigation and damageour reputation.  We receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and teammates. The use of thisinformation by us is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third party contracts. If our security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and thisinformation is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition ofpenalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure it remains in compliance.   14 Identification of material weakness in internal control may adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Thoseprovisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control. If such a material weakness is identified, it could indicate a lack of adequate controls to generate accurate financial statements. We routinely assess ourinternal controls, but we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure youthat we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting team members, especially in light of the increased demand for such individuals among publicly traded companies.  Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.  Otherrisk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes ineconomic conditions and financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates and costs for consumers and reduced disposable income); credit availability; increased costs of food commodities; increased fuel costs and availability for ourteam members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events; consumer perceptions of food safety; changes in consumer tastes and behaviors; governmental monetary policies;changes in demographic trends; availability of employees; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms) and other acts of God.  "
5,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2011-08-29,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS.  We wish tocaution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from those projectedin forward-looking statements contained in this report, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases, written or electronic communications, and verbal statements by our representatives. You should be aware that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause our or ourindustrys actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generallyaccompanied by words like believes, anticipates, estimates, predicts, expects, and other similar expressions that convey uncertainty about future events or outcomes. Risks Related to Our Business Competition may adversely affect our operations and financial results.  The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, nutritional and dietary trends and food quality, and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, economicconditions, population and traffic patterns. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains, some of which operate more restaurants and have greater financial resources and longeroperating histories than ours. Despite a weak U.S. employment market, there is active competition for quality management personnel and hourly team members. We continue to face competition as a result of the trend toward convergence in grocery, deliand restaurant services, including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals in the form of improved entrees and side dishes, as well as the trend in quick service and fast casual restaurants toward higher quality food and beverageofferings. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs. Our restaurants also face competition from the introduction of new products and menu items by competitors, as well as substantial pricediscounting and other offers, and are likely to face such competition in the future. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the future success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highly difficult to predict andwill be influenced by competitive product offerings, pricing and promotions offered by competitors. Our ability to differentiate our brands from their competitors, which is in part limited by the advertising monies available to us and by consumerperception, cannot be assured. These factors could reduce the gross sales or profitability at our restaurants, which would reduce the revenues generated by company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchisees. Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The food service industryas a whole rests on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels, and the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet, nutrition and health. We and our franchiseesdepend on the sustained demand for our products, which may be affected by factors we do not control. Changes in nutritional guidelines issued by the federal government agencies, issuance of similar guidelines or statistical information by otherfederal, state or local   7 municipalities, academic studies, or advocacy organizations among other things, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by ourrestaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt our menu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our company-operated restaurants and the payments wereceive from franchisees.  The global economic crisis continued to adversely impact our business andfinancial results in fiscal 2011 and a prolonged economic recovery could materially affect us in the future.  Therestaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending. Consumer confidence has not recovered from historic lows impacting the publics ability and/or desire to spend discretionary dollars as a result of job losses, homeforeclosures, significantly reduced home values, investment losses in the financial markets, personal bankruptcies and reduced access to credit, resulting in lower levels of guest traffic in our restaurants. While sales and traffic gains havebeen made by the restaurant industry and our restaurants in fiscal 2011, much of the economic improvement in the restaurant industry has come from cost savings initiatives. If this current weak economic recovery continues for a prolonged period oftime and/or deepens in magnitude returning to the negative trends of the prior two years, our business, results of operations and ability to comply with the covenants under our credit facility could be materially affected. Deterioration inguest traffic and/or a reduction in the average amount guests spend in our restaurants will negatively impact our revenues. This will result in lower royalties collected, sales deleverage, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales,and will, in turn cause downward pressure on our profitability. The result could be further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures. In addition, the adverse fiscal condition of any stateswhere we operate restaurants could result in these state governments issuing IOUs rather than tax refunds or employee paychecks, which could affect guest spending patterns in these locations. Future weak global economic results or recessionary effects on us are unknown at this time and could have a potential material adverseeffect on our financial position and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the governments plan to restore fiscal responsibility or future plans to stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence, stabilize thefinancial markets, increase liquidity and the availability of credit, or result in lower unemployment, which remains stubbornly high at the present time.  The current weak economic recovery could have a material adverse impact on our landlords or other tenants in retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located, which in turn could negativelyaffect our financial results.  If the weak economic recovery continues or returns to recessionary levels, our landlords maybe unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing under their existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition other tenants at retailcenters in which we or our franchisees are located or have executed leases may fail to open or may cease operations. If our landlords fail to satisfy required co-tenancies, such failures may result in us or our franchisees terminating leases ordelaying openings in these locations. Also, decreases in total tenant occupancy in retail centers in which we are located may affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on ouroperations.  Inflation may increase our operating expenses.  We have experienced impact from inflation. Inflation has caused increased food, labor and benefits costs and has increased our operating expenses. As operating expenses increase, we, to the extentpermitted by competition, recover increased costs by increasing menu prices, or by reviewing, then implementing, alternative products or processes, or by implementing other cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, that we will be ableto continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.   8 Changes in governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability tomaintain our existing and future operations and to open new restaurants.  We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act(which governs such matters as minimum wages, overtime and other working conditions), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted,or rules and regulations promulgated by federal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters, including, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status. We expect increases inpayroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage, and although such increases are not expected to be material, we cannot assure you that there will not be material increases in the future. Enactment andenforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for our restaurants in a particular area or across the United States. Otherlabor shortages or increased team member turnover could also increase labor costs. In addition, our vendors may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply tous. We continue to review the health care reform law enacted by Congress in March of 2010 and regulations issued related to the law to evaluate the potential impact of this new law on our business, and to accommodate various parts of the law as theytake effect. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases can accommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.  We are subject to laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increasedcosts and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We do not expect to incur material costs from compliance with the provision of the new health care lawrequiring disclosure of calories on the menus, but cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behavior resulting from implementation of this portion of the law, which could have adverse effects on our sales or results of operations. Each of our and our franchisees restaurants is also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health,sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality where the restaurant is located. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and approvalsthat could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Although we do not, at this time, anticipate any occurring in the future, we cannot assure you that we or our franchiseeswill not experience material difficulties or failures that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay the opening of restaurants in the future.  We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on our operations, we cannot ensure that there will not be a materialnegative effect in the future. In particular, the U.S. and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and water conservation. This increased focus may lead to new initiativesdirected at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costs associated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costsand utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance. Further, more stringent and varied requirements of local and stategovernmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay, prevent or make cost prohibitive the continuing operations of an existing restaurant or the development of new restaurants in particular locations. The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of future changes in laws or regulations that impose additionalrequirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues, could increase our compliance and other costs of doingbusiness and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations.   9 Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in, among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrativeenforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings. Our profitability may be adversely affected by increases in energy costs.  Our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs, in particular electricity and natural gas. Various regions of the United States in which we operate multiple restaurantshave experienced in the recent past significant increases in utility prices. These increases have affected costs and if they occur again, it would have possible adverse effects on our profitability to the extent not otherwise recoverable throughprice increases or alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures. Further, higher prices for petroleum-based fuels may be passed on to us by vendors putting further pressure on margins as well as impact our guests discretionary fundsand ability to patron our restaurants or guests menu choices.  Shortages or interruptions in theavailability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reduce revenues.  Possible shortages orinterruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused by inclement weather, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market, foodsafety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements, or other conditions beyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability toeffectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of products critical to our restaurant operations.  Successful mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions are important to our future growth and profitability. We evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, franchisees of new and existing restaurants, joint venture investments, and divestitures aspart of our strategic planning initiative. These transactions involve various inherent risks, including accurately assessing:      the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition or divestiturecandidates;      our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies;     unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business; and     our ability to complete divestitures on acceptable terms and at or near the prices estimated as attainable by us. If we are unable to meet our business strategy plan, our profitability in the future may be adversely affected. Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchiseesability to:      increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options and high quality service desired by our gueststhrough successful implementation of strategic initiatives;      identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including remodeling of existing restaurants and new restaurantdevelopment;      identify available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants;   10    obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis;     hire all necessary contractors and subcontractors, obtain construction materials at suitable prices, and maintain construction schedules; and     hire and train or retain qualified managers and team members for existing and new restaurants. The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth.  We have significantly increased the percentage of restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements are designed to maintain brand consistency, this increase reduces ourdirect day-to-day control over these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control of same. These risks include franchisee defaults in their obligations to us arising from financial or otherdifficulties encountered by them, such as payments to us or maintenance and improvements obligations; limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; inability to participate in business strategychanges due to financial constraints; inability to meet rent obligations on leases on which we retain contingent liability; and failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements subjecting us to litigation even when we are not legallyliable for a franchisees actions or failure to act.  Our sales volumes generally decrease in winter months. Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally and are generally higher in the summer months and lower in the winter months, which may causeseasonal fluctuations in our operating results.  Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of ourrestaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.  Multi-unit restaurant businesses can beadversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness or health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chilis brand for a majority ofour revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chilis restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chilis brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on information technology and any material failure of that technology could impair our ability toefficiently operate our business.  We rely on information systems across our operations, including, for example,point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our business depends significantly on thereliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in customerservice and reduce efficiency in our operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems.  We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in business and increased costs. Some business processes are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes include gift card tracking and authorization, creditcard authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes to determine if additional outsourcing is a viableoption to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant   11 processing facilities; however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and management reporting. Continuing disruptions in the global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit andconsumer spending patterns.  The continuing disruptions to the global financial markets and continuing weak economicrecovery has adversely impacted the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future. The disruptions in the financial markets also had an adverse effect on the U.S. and world economy, which hasnegatively impacted consumer spending patterns. There can be no assurance that various U.S. and world government present and future responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets orincrease liquidity or the availability of credit.  Declines in the market price of our common stock orchanges in other circumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.  We perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are also required when events or circumstances change between annual tests thatwould more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in the market price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, orin the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact the valuation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge torecognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, our financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected. Changes to estimates related to our property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than ourcurrent estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets. We make certain estimates and projections with regards to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance inconnection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value or undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. The projection of future cash flowsused in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. Ifimpairment charges are significant, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  Failure toprotect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and teammates could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation.  We receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and teammates. The use of this information by us is regulated at the federal and state levels, as well as by certain third partycontracts. If our security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affectour reputation, as well as operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additionalcosts to ensure it remains in compliance.  Identification of material weakness in internal control may adversely affect our financialresults.  We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.Those provisions provide for the identification of material weaknesses in internal control. If such a material   12 weakness is identified, it could indicate a lack of adequate controls to generate accurate financial statements. We routinely assess our internal controls, but we cannot assure you that we willbe able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilledfinance and accounting team members, especially in light of the increased demand for such individuals among publicly traded companies. Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance.  Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumerconfidence, include, without limitation, changes in economic conditions and financial and credit markets (including rising interest rates and costs for consumers and reduced disposable income); credit availability; increased costs of foodcommodities; increased fuel costs and availability for our team members, customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events (such as reports on swine flu); consumer perceptions offood safety; changes in consumer tastes and behaviors; governmental monetary policies; changes in demographic trends; availability of employees; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes andregional winter storms) and other acts of God.   "
12,EAT,BRINKER INTL INC,2010-08-24,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS.  We wish tocaution you that our business and operations are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. The factors listed below are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical results and from those projectedin forward-looking statements contained in this report, in our other filings with the SEC, in our news releases, written or electronic communications, and verbal statements by our representatives. You should be aware that forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may cause our or ourindustrys actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performances or achievements contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are generallyaccompanied by words like believes, anticipates, estimates, predicts, expects, and other similar expressions that convey uncertainty about future events or outcomes. Risks Related to Our Business Competition may adversely affect our operations and financial results. The restaurant business is highly competitive as to price, service, restaurant location, nutritional and dietary trends and food quality,and is often affected by changes in consumer tastes, economic conditions, population and traffic patterns. We compete within each market with locally-owned restaurants as well as national and regional restaurant chains, some of which operate morerestaurants and have greater financial resources and longer operating histories than ours. There is active competition for management personnel and hourly team members. We face growing competition as a result of the trend toward convergence ingrocery, deli and restaurant services, including the offering by the grocery industry of convenient meals in the form of improved entrees and side dishes, as well as the trend in quick service and fast casual restaurants toward higher quality foodand beverage offerings. We compete primarily on the quality, variety and value perception of menu items, as well as the quality and efficiency of service, the attractiveness of facilities and the effectiveness of advertising and marketing programs. Our restaurants also face competition from the introduction of new products and menu items by competitors, as well assubstantial price discounting and other offers, and are likely to face such competition in the future. Although we may implement a number of business strategies, the future success of new products, initiatives and overall strategies is highlydifficult to predict and will be influenced by competitive product offerings, pricing and promotions offered by competitors. Our ability to differentiate our brands from their competitors, which is in part limited by the advertising monies availableto us and by consumer perception, cannot be assured. These factors could reduce the gross sales or profitability at our restaurants, which would reduce the revenues generated by company-owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchisees. Changing health or dietary preferences may cause consumers to avoid our products in favor of alternative foods. The foodservice industry as a whole rests on consumer preferences and demographic trends at the local, regional, national and international levels, and the impact on consumer eating habits of new information regarding diet, nutrition and health. We and ourfranchisees depend on the sustained demand for our products, which may be affected by factors we do not control. Changes in nutritional guidelines issued by the federal government agencies, issuance of similar guidelines or statistical informationby other federal, state or local municipalities, or academic studies, among other things, may impact consumer choice and cause consumers to select foods other than those that are offered by our restaurants. We may not be able to adequately adapt ourmenu offerings to keep pace with developments in current consumer preferences, which may result in reductions to the revenues generated by our company-operated restaurants and the payments we receive from franchisees.  8 The global economic crisis continued to adversely impact our businessand financial results in fiscal 2010 and a prolonged recession could materially affect us in the future.  The restaurantindustry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending. The global economic crisis has reduced consumer confidence to historic lows impacting the publics ability and/or desire to spend discretionary dollars as a result of job losses,home foreclosures, significantly reduced home values, investment losses in the financial markets, personal bankruptcies and reduced access to credit, resulting in lower levels of guest traffic in our restaurants. If this current difficulteconomic situation continues for a prolonged period of time and/or deepens in magnitude, our business, results of operations and ability to comply with the covenants under our credit facility could be materially affected. Continueddeterioration in guest traffic and/or a reduction in the average amount guests spend in our restaurants will negatively impact our revenues. This will result in sales deleverage, spreading fixed costs across a lower level of sales, and will, inturn cause downward pressure on our profitability. The result could be further reductions in staff levels, asset impairment charges and potential restaurant closures. In addition, the adverse fiscal condition of any states where we operaterestaurants could result in these state governments issuing IOUs rather than tax refunds or employee paychecks, which could affect guest spending patterns in these locations. Future recessionary effects on us are unknown at this time and could have a potential material adverse effect on our financial positionand results of operations. There can be no assurance that the governments plan to stimulate the economy will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the financial markets, increase liquidity and the availability of credit, or result inlower unemployment.  The current economic crisis could have a material adverse impact on our landlords orother tenants in retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located, which in turn could negatively affect our financial results. If the recession continues or increases in severity, our landlords may be unable to obtain financing or remain in good standing undertheir existing financing arrangements, resulting in failures to pay required construction contributions or satisfy other lease covenants to us. In addition other tenants at retail centers in which we or our franchisees are located or haveexecuted leases may fail to open or may cease operations. If our landlords fail to satisfy required co-tenancies, such failures may result in us or our franchisees terminating leases or delaying openings in these locations. Also, decreasesin total tenant occupancy in retail centers in which we are located may affect guest traffic at our restaurants. All of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Inflation may increase our operating expenses. We have experienced impact from inflation. Inflation has caused increased food, labor and benefits costs and has increased our operatingexpenses. As operating expenses increase, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover increased costs by increasing menu prices, or by reviewing, then implementing, alternative products or processes, or by implementing other cost reductionprocedures. We cannot ensure, however, that we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner. Changes in governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to maintain our existing and future operationsand to open new restaurants.  We are subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act (which governs such matters as minimum wages,overtime and other working conditions), along with the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, various family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted, or rules and regulations promulgated byfederal, state and local governmental authorities that govern these and other employment matters, including, tip credits, working conditions, safety standards and immigration status. We expect increases in payroll expenses as a result of federal andstate mandated increases in the minimum wage, and although such   9 increases are not expected to be material, we cannot assure you that there will not be material increases in the future. Enactment and enforcement of various federal, state and local laws, rulesand regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for our restaurants in a particular area or across the United States. Other labor shortages or increased team member turnover could alsoincrease labor costs. In addition, our vendors may be affected by higher minimum wage standards or availability of labor, which may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us. We are reviewing the health care reform law enacted byCongress in March of 2010 to evaluate the potential impact of this new law on our business, and to accommodate various parts of the law as they take effect. There are no assurances that a combination of cost management and price increases canaccommodate all of the costs associated with compliance.  We are subject to laws and regulations, which vary from jurisdictionto jurisdiction, relating to nutritional content and menu labeling. Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity, changes in sales mix and profitability, and increased exposure to governmentalinvestigations or litigation. We do not expect to incur material costs from compliance with the provision of the new health care law requiring disclosure of calories on the menus, but cannot reliably anticipate any changes in guest behaviorresulting from implementation of this portion of the law, which could have adverse effects on our sales or results of operations. Each of our and our franchisees restaurants is also subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, health,sanitation, safety and fire agencies in the state, county and/or municipality where the restaurant is located. We generally have not encountered any material difficulties or failures in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses and approvalsthat could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant. Although we do not, at this time, anticipate any occurring in the future, we cannot assure you that we or our franchiseeswill not experience material difficulties or failures that could impact the continuing operations of an existing restaurant, or delay the opening of restaurants in the future. We are also subject to federal and state environmental regulations, and although these have not had a material negative effect on ouroperations, we cannot ensure that there will not be a material negative effect in the future. In particular, the U.S. and other foreign governments have increased focus on environmental matters such as climate change, greenhouse gases and waterconservation. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an as yet unspecified array of environmental matters. These efforts could result in increased taxation or in future restrictions on or increases in costsassociated with food and other restaurant supplies, transportation costs and utility costs, any of which could decrease our operating profits and/or necessitate future investments in our restaurant facilities and equipment to achieve compliance.Further, more stringent and varied requirements of local and state governmental bodies with respect to zoning, land use and environmental factors could delay, prevent or make cost prohibitive the continuing operations of an existing restaurant orthe development of new restaurants in particular locations.  The impact of current laws and regulations, the effect of futurechanges in laws or regulations that impose additional requirements and the consequences of litigation relating to current or future laws and regulations, or our inability to respond effectively to significant regulatory or public policy issues,could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business and therefore have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Failure to comply with the laws and regulatory requirements of federal, state and local authorities could result in,among other things, revocation of required licenses, administrative enforcement actions, fines and civil and criminal liability. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and can increase our exposure to litigation or governmentalinvestigations or proceedings.  Our profitability may be adversely affected by increases in energy costs. Our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs, in particular electricity and natural gas. Variousregions of the United States in which we operate multiple restaurants have experienced in the recent past significant increases in utility prices. These increases have affected costs and if they occur again,  10 it would have possible adverse effects on our profitability to the extent not otherwise recoverable through price increases or alternative products, processes or cost reduction procedures.Further, higher prices for petroleum-based fuels may be passed on to us by vendors putting further pressure on margins. Shortages or interruptions in the availability and delivery of food and other supplies may increase costs or reducerevenues.  Possible shortages or interruptions in the supply of food items and other supplies to our restaurants caused byinclement weather, natural disasters such as floods, drought and hurricanes, the inability of our vendors to obtain credit in a tightened credit market, food safety warnings or advisories or the prospect of such pronouncements, or other conditionsbeyond our control could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of items we buy and the operations of our restaurants. Our inability to effectively manage supply chain risk could increase our costs and limit the availability of productscritical to our restaurant operations.  Successful mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other strategictransactions are important to our future growth and profitability.  We evaluate potential mergers, acquisitions,franchisees of new and existing restaurants, joint venture investments, and divestitures as part of our strategic planning initiative. These transactions involve various inherent risks, including accurately assessing:     the value, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition or divestiturecandidates;      our ability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies;     unanticipated changes in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business; and     our ability to complete divestitures on acceptable terms and at or near the prices estimated as attainable by us. If we are unable to meet our business strategy plan, our profitability in the future may be adversely affected.  Our ability to meet our business strategy plan is dependent upon, among other things, our and our franchisees abilityto:      increase gross sales and operating profits at existing restaurants with food and beverage options and high quality service desired by our gueststhrough successful implementation of strategic initiatives;      identify adequate sources of capital to fund and finance strategic initiatives, including remodeling of existing restaurants and new restaurantdevelopment;      identify available, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants;     obtain all required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquor licenses) on a timely basis;     hire all necessary contractors and subcontractors, obtain construction materials at suitable prices, and maintain construction schedules; and     hire and train or retain qualified managers and team members for existing and new restaurants. The success of our franchisees is important to our future growth. We have significantly increased the percentage of restaurants owned and operated by our franchisees. While our franchise agreements aredesigned to maintain brand consistency, this increase reduces our direct day-to-day   11 control over these restaurants and may expose us to risks not otherwise encountered if we maintained ownership and control of same. These risks include franchisee defaults in their obligations tous arising from financial or other difficulties encountered by them, such as payments to us or maintenance and improvements obligations; limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings; inability toparticipate in business strategy changes due to financial constraints; inability to meet rent obligations on leases on which we retain contingent liability; and failure to comply with food quality and preparation requirements subjecting us tolitigation even when we are not legally liable for a franchisees actions or failure to act.  Our sales volumes generally decrease inwinter months.  Our sales volumes fluctuate seasonally and are generally higher in the summer months and lower in thewinter months, which may cause seasonal fluctuations in our operating results.  Unfavorable publicityrelating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.  Multi-unitrestaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness or health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants. In particular, since we depend heavily on theChilis brand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one or more Chilis restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chilis brand, and consequently on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.  We are dependent on information technology and any material failure of thattechnology could impair our ability to efficiently operate our business.  We rely on information systems across ouroperations, including, for example, point-of-sale processing in our restaurants, management of our supply chain, collection of cash, payment of obligations and various other processes and procedures. Our ability to efficiently manage our businessdepends significantly on the reliability and capacity of these systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with maintenance, upgrading or transitioning to replacement systems, or a breach in security of these systems couldcause delays in customer service and reduce efficiency in our operations. Significant capital investments might be required to remediate any problems. We outsource certain business processes to third-party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions inbusiness and increased costs.  Some business processes are currently outsourced to third parties. Such processes includegift card tracking and authorization, credit card authorization and processing, insurance claims processing, certain payroll processing, tax filings and other accounting processes. We also continue to evaluate our other business processes todetermine if additional outsourcing is a viable option to accomplish our goals. We make a diligent effort to ensure that all providers of outsourced services are observing proper internal control practices, such as redundant processing facilities;however, there are no guarantees that failures will not occur. Failure of third parties to provide adequate services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or ability to accomplish our financial and managementreporting.  Disruptions in the financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of creditand consumer spending patterns.  The disruptions to the financial markets and continuing economic downturn has adverselyimpacted the availability of credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit in the future. The disruptions in the financial markets also had an adverse effect on the U.S. and world economy, which has negatively impacted consumerspending patterns. There can be no assurance that various U.S. and world government present and future responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase liquidity or theavailability of credit.   12 Declines in the market price of our common stock or changes in othercircumstances that may indicate an impairment of goodwill could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. We perform our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter of each fiscal year. Interim goodwill impairment tests are alsorequired when events or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying value. It is possible that a change in circumstances such as the decline in themarket price of our common stock or changes in consumer spending levels, or in the numerous variables associated with the judgments, assumptions and estimates made in assessing the appropriate valuation of our goodwill, could negatively impact thevaluation of our brands and create the potential for a non-cash charge to recognize impairment losses on some or all of our goodwill. If we were required to write down a portion of our goodwill and record related non-cash impairment charges, ourfinancial position and results of operations would be adversely affected.  Changes to estimates related toour property and equipment, or operating results that are lower than our current estimates at certain restaurant locations, may cause us to incur impairment charges on certain long-lived assets. We make certain estimates and projections with regards to individual restaurant operations, as well as our overall performance inconnection with our impairment analyses for long-lived assets. An impairment charge is required when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value or undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. The projection of future cash flowsused in this analysis requires the use of judgment and a number of estimates and projections of future operating results. If actual results differ from our estimates, additional charges for asset impairments may be required in the future. Ifimpairment charges are significant, our results of operations could be adversely affected.  Failure toprotect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our guests and teammates could expose us to litigation and damage our reputation. We receive and maintain certain personal information about our guests and teammates. The use of this information by us is regulated at thefederal and state levels, as well as by certain third party contracts. If our security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorizedpersons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as operations, results of operations and financial condition, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and informationsecurity laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure it remains in compliance. Identification of material weakness in internal control may adversely affect our financial results. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Those provisions providefor the identification of material weaknesses in internal control. If such a material weakness is identified, it could indicate a lack of adequate controls to generate accurate financial statements. We routinely assess our internal controls, but wecannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able toretain sufficient skilled finance and accounting team members, especially in light of the increased demand for such individuals among publicly traded companies. Other risk factors may adversely affect our financial performance. Other risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements byaffecting, among many things, pricing, consumer spending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes in economic conditions and financial and credit markets (including rising  13 interest rates and costs for consumers and reduced disposable income); credit availability; increased costs of food commodities; increased fuel costs and availability for our team members,customers and suppliers; increased health care costs; health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects of these events (such as reports on swine flu); consumer perceptions of food safety; changes in consumer tastes and behaviors; governmental monetarypolicies; changes in demographic trends; availability of employees; terrorist acts; energy shortages and rolling blackouts; and weather (including, major hurricanes and regional winter storms) and other acts of God.  "

Weexpect increases in payroll expenses as a result of federal and state mandated increases in the minimum wage. In addition, our vendors may be affected by higher minimum wage standards, which mayincrease the price of goods and services they supply to us. Inflation may increase our operating expenses.          We have not experienced a significant overall impact from inflation. Inflation can cause increased food, labor and benefits costs and can increase our operatingexpenses. As operating expenses increase, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recover increased costs by increasing menu prices, or by reviewing, then implementing, alternative products orprocesses, or by implementing other cost reduction procedures. We cannot ensure, however, that we will be able to continue to recover increases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner. Our profitability may be adversely affected by increases in energy costs.          Our success depends in part on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs.

Thelabor and materials costs involved vary geographically and are subject to general price increases. As a result, future capital expenditure costs of restaurant development may increase, reducingprofitability. We cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our capacity in accordance with our growth objectives or that the new restaurants and brands opened or acquired will be profitable. Unfavorable publicity relating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of the brand.          Multi-unit restaurant businesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality, illness or health concerns or operatingissues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants.

Inaddition, our vendors may be affected by higher minimum wage standards, whichmay increase the price of goods and services they supply to us.Inflation may increase our operating expenses.We have not experienced asignificant overall impact from inflation. Inflation can cause increased food,labor and benefits costs and can increase our operating expenses. As operatingexpenses increase, we, to the extent permitted by competition, recoverincreased costs by increasing menu prices, or by reviewing, then implementing,alternative products or processes, or by implementing other cost reduction procedures.We cannot ensure, however, that we will be able to continue to recoverincreases in operating expenses due to inflation in this manner.Our profitability may be adversely affected byincreases in energy costs.Our success depends inpart on our ability to absorb increases in utility costs. Various regions ofthe United States in which we operate multiple restaurants have experiencedsignificant increases in utility prices. If these increases continue to occur,it would have an adverse effect on our profitability.Successful mergers, acquisitions, divestitures andother strategic transactions are important to our future growth andprofitability.Weevaluate potential mergers, acquisitions, joint venture investments, anddivestitures as part of our strategic planning initiative. These transactionsinvolve various inherent risks, including accurately assessing:·       thevalue, future growth potential, strengths, weaknesses, contingent and otherliabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates;·       ourability to achieve projected economic and operating synergies; unanticipatedchanges in business and economic conditions affecting an acquired business; and·       our ability to completedivestitures on acceptable terms and at or near the prices estimated asattainable by us.9If we are unable tomeet our growth plan, our profitability in the future may be adverselyaffected.Our ability to meetour growth plan is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to:·       identifyavailable, suitable and economically viable locations for new restaurants,·       obtainall required governmental permits (including zoning approvals and liquorlicenses) on a timely basis,·       hireall necessary contractors and subcontractors, and·       meetconstruction schedules.The costs related torestaurant and brand development include purchases and leases of land,buildings and equipment and facility and equipment maintenance, repair andreplacement. The labor and materials costs involved vary geographically and aresubject to general price increases. As a result, future capital expenditurecosts of restaurant development may increase, reducing profitability. We cannotassure you that we will be able to expand our capacity in accordance with ourgrowth objectives or that the new restaurants and brands opened or acquiredwill be profitable.Unfavorable publicityrelating to one or more of our restaurants in a particular brand may taint public perception of thebrand.Multi-unit restaurantbusinesses can be adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality,illness or health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limitednumber of restaurants. In particular, since we depend heavily on the Chilisbrand for a majority of our revenues, unfavorable publicity relating to one ormore Chilis restaurants could have a material adverse effect on the Chilisbrand, and consequently on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.Identification ofmaterial weakness in internal control may adversely affect our financialresults.We are subject to theongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-OxleyAct of 2002. Those provisions provide for the identification of materialweaknesses in internal control. If such a material weakness is identified, itcould indicate a lack of adequate controls to generate accurate financialstatements. We routinely assess our internal controls, but we cannot assure youthat we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may beidentified in future periods, or maintain all of the controls necessary forcontinued compliance. Likewise, we cannot assure you that we will be able toretain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in lightof the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.Other risk factorsmay adversely affect our financial performance.Other risk factors thatcould cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated in theforward-looking statements by affecting, among many things, pricing, consumerspending and consumer confidence, include, without limitation, changes ineconomic conditions, increased fuel costs and availability for our employees,customers and suppliers, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospects ofthese events (such as recent reports on avian flu), consumer perceptions offood safety, changes in consumer tastes and behaviors, governmental monetarypolicies, changes in demographic trends, availability of employees, terroristacts, energy shortages and rolling blackouts, and weather (including, majorhurricanes and regional snow storms) and other acts of God"
