13,HUBB,HUBBELL INC,2011-02-16,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     Our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash    flows may be impacted by a number of factors including, but not    limited to those set forth below. Any one of these factors could    cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results    or future anticipated results. See also Item 7.    Managements Discussion and Analysis     Executive Overview of the Business,    Outlook, and Results of Operations.    7Table of ContentsWe    operate in markets that are subject to competitive pressures    that could affect selling prices or demand for our    products.     We compete on the basis of product performance, quality, service    and/or    price. Our competitive strategy is to design and manufacture    high quality products at the lowest possible cost. Our    competitors include companies that have greater sales and    financial resources than our Company. Competition could affect    future selling prices or demand for our products. Global    economic uncertainty could adversely affect us.     During periods of global economic uncertainty, we could    experience declines in revenues, profitability and cash flow due    to reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or    other factors caused by economic challenges faced by our    customers, prospective customers and suppliers. We source    products and materials from various suppliers located in    countries throughout the world. A disruption in the    availability, price, or quality of these products could impact    our operating results.     We use a variety of raw materials in the production of our    products including steel, aluminum, brass, copper, bronze, zinc,    nickel and plastics. We also purchase certain electrical and    electronic components, including lighting ballasts, printed    circuit boards and integrated circuit chips from third party    providers. We have multiple sources of supply for these products    and are not dependent on any single supplier. However,    significant shortages of these materials or price increases    could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the    competitive positions of our products which would directly    impact our results of operations.     We continue to increase the amount of product materials,    components and finished goods that are sourced from low cost    countries including Mexico, China, and other countries in Asia.    A political disruption or significant changes related to    transportation to    and/or from    one of these countries could affect the availability of these    materials and components which would directly impact our results    of operations.     We rely on our suppliers in low cost countries to produce high    quality materials, components and finished goods according to    our specifications. Although we have quality control procedures    in place, there is a risk that products may not meet our    specifications which could impact our ability to ship high    quality products to our customers on a timely basis and this    could adversely impact our results of operations. Changes    in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities    could have a material impact on our financial condition, results    of operations and liquidity.     We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based    taxes, in both the United States and various foreign    jurisdictions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various    jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain    positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We    regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to    determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However,    there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the    outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these    audits could adversely affect our results of operations,    financial condition and cash flows. We engage    in acquisitions and strategic investments and may encounter    difficulty in obtaining appropriate acquisitions and in    integrating these businesses.     We have pursued and will continue to seek potential acquisitions    and other strategic investments to complement and expand our    existing businesses within our core markets. The rate and extent    to which appropriate acquisitions become available may impact    our growth rate. The success of these transactions will depend    on our ability to integrate these businesses into our    operations. We may encounter difficulties in integrating    acquisitions into our operations and in managing strategic    investments. Therefore, we may not realize the degree or timing    of expected synergies and benefits anticipated when we first    enter into a transaction.    8Table of ContentsOur    operating results may be impacted by actions related to our    enterprise-wide business system.     We completed our SAP software implementation at the majority of    our domestic businesses in 2006. Since then, we have continued    to work on standardizing business processes and improving our    understanding and utilization of the system. Based upon the    complexity of this system, there is risk that we will continue    to incur additional costs to enhance the system, perform process    reengineering and future implementations at our remaining    businesses and post 2006 acquisitions. Any future reengineering    or implementations could result in operating inefficiencies    which could impact our operating results or our ability to    perform necessary business transactions. A    deterioration in the credit quality of our customers could have    a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial    condition.     We have an extensive customer base of distributors and    wholesalers, electric utilities, OEMs, electrical contractors,    telecommunications companies, and retail and hardware outlets.    We are not dependent on a single customer, however, our top 10    customers account for approximately 31% of our total accounts    receivable. A deterioration in credit quality of several major    customers could adversely affect our results of operations,    financial condition and cash flows. Inability    to access capital markets may adversely affect our    business.     Our ability to invest in our business and make strategic    acquisitions may require access to the capital markets. If we    are unable to access the capital markets, we could experience a    material adverse affect on our business and financial results. We have    two classes of common stock with different voting rights, which    results in a concentration of voting power of our common    stock.     As of December 31, 2010, the holders of our Class A    common stock (with 20 votes per share) held approximately 73% of    the voting power represented by all outstanding shares of our    common stock and approximately 12% of the Companys total    equity value, and the Hubbell Trust and Roche Trust collectively    held approximately 49% of our Class A common stock. The    holders of the Class A common stock thus are in a position    to influence matters that are brought to a vote of the holders    of our common stock, including, among others, the election of    the board of directors, any amendments to our charter documents,    and the approval of material transactions. In order to further    the interests of our shareholders, the Company routinely reviews    various alternatives to meet its capital structure objectives,    including equity, reclassification and debt transactions. We are    subject to litigation and environmental regulations that may    adversely impact our operating results.     We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal    proceedings and claims, including those involving product    liability, patent and environmental matters, which could be    significant. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we    can offer no assurance that a future adverse development related    to existing litigation or any future litigation will not have a    material adverse impact to our business. We are also subject to    various laws and regulations relating to environmental    protection and the discharge of materials into the environment,    and we could incur substantial costs as a result of the    noncompliance with or liability for clean up or other costs or    damages under environmental laws. In addition, we could be    affected by future laws or regulations, including those imposed    in response to climate change concerns. Compliance with any    future laws and regulations could result in an adverse affect on    our business and financial results. We face    the potential harms of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of    war, international conflicts or other disruptions to our    operations.     Natural disasters, acts or threats of war or terrorism,    international conflicts, and the actions taken by the    United States and other governments in response to such    events could cause damage to or disrupt our business operations,    our suppliers or our customers, and could create political or    economic instability, any of which could have an adverse effect    on our business. Although it is not possible to predict such    events or their consequences, these    9Table of Contents    events could decrease demand for our products, make it difficult    or impossible for us to deliver products, or disrupt our supply    chain. "

Competition could affect    future selling prices or demand for our products. A global    recession and continued worldwide credit constraints could    adversely affect us.     Recent global economic events, including concerns over the tight    credit markets and failures or material business deterioration    of financial institutions and other entities, have resulted in a    continued concern regarding the global recession. If these    conditions continue or worsen, we could experience additional    declines in revenues, profitability and cash flow due to reduced    orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other    factors caused by economic challenges faced by our customers,    prospective customers and suppliers. We source    products and materials from various suppliers located in    countries throughout the world.

However, significant shortages of these materials or price    increases could increase our operating costs and adversely    impact the competitive positions of our products which would    directly impact our results of operations.     We continue to increase the amount of product materials,    components and finished goods which are sourced from low cost    countries including Mexico, China, and other countries in Asia.    A political disruption or significant changes related to    transportation from one of these countries could affect the    availability of these materials and components which would    directly impact our results of operations. We engage    in acquisitions and strategic investments and may encounter    difficulty in integrating these businesses.     We have pursued and will continue to seek potential acquisitions    and other strategic investments to complement and expand our    existing businesses within our core markets. In 2006 we    completed two acquisitions. The success of these transactions    will depend on our ability to integrate these businesses into    our operations. We may encounter difficulties in integrating    acquisitions into our operations and in managing strategic    investments. Therefore, we may not realize the degree or timing    of the benefits anticipated when we first enter into a    transaction. Our    operating results may be impacted by actions related to our    lighting integration and rationalization program.     We continue to execute a multi-year program to integrate and    rationalize our lighting businesses through facility    consolidations, workforce reductions and product    rationalizations. These activities consist of complex    relocations of critical personnel and machinery and equipment,    as well as hiring and training of new personnel and, in some    cases, expansion or other modification to facilities. All of    these activities are thoroughly planned and under the direction    of experienced management personnel. However, the actions are    occurring simultaneous with normal    9Table of Contents    business operations and other initiatives. Therefore, there is a    risk that (1) we may not complete the activities on a    timely basis and incur duplicate or higher costs, (2) we    may lose essential personnel and knowledge in transition and    have to reestablish processes and procedures, and (3) our    normal operations could be disrupted and interfere with our    ability to manufacture and ship our products to satisfy the    demands of our customers. Our    operating results may be impacted by actions related to our    enterprise-wide business system initiative.     We have substantially completed the implementation of SAP    software throughout most of our domestic businesses. This    activity involved the migration of multiple legacy systems and    users to a common SAP information platform. Throughout this    process, we changed the way we conduct business and    employees roles in processing and utilizing information.    In addition, certain interfaces with our customers and suppliers    have been impacted which resulted in changes to the tools we use    to take orders, procure material, schedule production, remit    billings, make payments and perform other business functions.    Based upon the complexity of this initiative, there is risk that    (1) we will incur additional costs to continue to enhance    the system and perform process reengineering, and (2) the    use of the new system or future implementations could result in    operating inefficiencies which could impact operating results or    our ability to perform necessary business transactions. All of    these risks could adversely impact our results of operations,    financial condition and cash flows. We are    subject to litigation and environmental regulations that may    adversely impact our operating results.     We are, and may in the future be, a party to a number of legal    proceedings and claims, including those involving product    liability and environmental matters, which could be significant.    Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, we can offer no    assurance that a future adverse development related to existing    litigation or any future litigation will not have a material    adverse impact. We are also subject to various laws and    regulations relating to environmental protection and the    discharge of materials into the environment, and we could incur    substantial costs as a result of the noncompliance with or    liability for clean up or other costs or damages under    environmental laws. "
