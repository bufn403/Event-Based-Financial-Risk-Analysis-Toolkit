.9Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The statements contained in this communication that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give the Company’s current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “could,” “estimate,” “expect,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “hope,” “intend,” “may,” “opinion,” “optimistic,” “plan,” “poised,” “predict,” “project,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will,” ""work to,"" and variations of such words and similar expressions. Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company’s control, and could cause the Company’s results to differ materially from those described. These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: changes in general industry or regional market conditions, including the impact of inflation; changes in consumer and customer preferences for our products (such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving); our ability to be awarded new business; continued uncertainty in pricing negotiations with customers and suppliers; loss of business from increased competition; changes in strategic relationships; customer bankruptcies or divestiture of customer brands; fluctuation in vehicle production schedules (including the impact of customer employee strikes); changes in product mix; raw material and other supply shortages; labor shortages, supply chain constraints and disruptions; our dependence on information systems; higher raw material, fuel, energy and other costs; unfavorable fluctuations in currencies or interest rates in the regions in which we operate; costs or difficulties related to the integration and/or ability to maximize the value of any new or acquired technologies and businesses; changes in regulatory conditions; warranty and recall claims and other litigation and customer reactions thereto; possible adverse results of pending or future litigation or infringement claims; changes in tax laws; import and export duty and tariff rates in or with the countries with which we conduct business; negative impact of any governmental investigations and associated litigation including securities litigation relating to the conduct of our business; and the length and severity of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, including its impact across our business on demand, operations, and the global supply chain. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Accordingly, any forward-looking statement should be read in conjunction with the additional information about risks and uncertainties identified under the heading “Risk Factors
” in the Company’s latest Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, which risks and uncertainties now include the impacts of COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic and supply chain constraints that have affected, are affecting, and will continue to affect, general economic and industry conditions, customers, suppliers, and the regulatory environment in which the Company operates. Includes content supplied by S&P Global Mobility / IHS Markit Light Vehicle Production Forecast (http://www.gentex.com/forecast-disclaimer).The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. Customers within the auto industry comprise approximately 97% of our net sales. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment, including inflation, continues to be uncertain, and continues to cause financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile automotive production levels, volatility with customer orders, supplier part and material shortages (especially electronics components), automotive and Tier 1 supplier plant shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues, commodity raw material cost increases, supply constraints, tariffs, consumer vehicle preference shifts (where we have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle), and supply chain stresses, all of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the fallout therefrom. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience significant plant shutdowns, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it will further disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs on time, due in part to continued vehicle complexity increases and supply chain constraints.  This brings increased risk of delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts. This makes it challenging for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments, in addition to the aforementioned factors.  Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including three automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2022 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, and General Motors. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. 10Pricing Pressures. We continue to experience ongoing pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the pricing pressures with price adjustments, engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, increases in unit shipments of mirrors and electronics with advanced features, and/or new or advanced technologies, each of which pose ongoing challenges, which could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Raw Materials and Other Product Component Costs. Increasing costs in raw materials, energy, commodities, labor, and other product component costs adversely affects our business, financial condition and/or results of operations. These costs have generally increased as a result of supply chain disruptions, constrained labor availability, global economic factors, as well as inflationary impacts. When these prices rise and we are unable to recover such cost increases from our customers, those increases have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations;Tariffs.  The geopolitical environment between the Unites States and other jurisdictions, most significantly China, continues to cause uncertainty on tariffs and trade. Previously enacted tariffs have increased the Company's input costs, and have the potential to challenge the Company's competitive position in foreign markets. The continuance of these tariffs and/or escalation of disputes in the geopolitical environment could continue to interfere with automotive supply chains and may have a continued negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and/or results of operations, especially since the Company primarily manufactures and ships from one location. We cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other governments, and any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could have a further adverse impact on our business. Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat. Additionally, other companies have demonstrated products that are competitive to our Full Display Mirror® system and other products.  We acknowledge that dimming device (e.g., electrochromic) technology is the subject of research and development efforts by numerous third parties. For example, our SmartBeam® product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products has already and could continue to impact the success of SmartBeam®. On March 31, 2014 the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (""NHTSA"") to allow automakers to use camera monitoring systems (""CMS"") as an option to replace conventional rearview mirrors within North America, however, no final rule or legislation was made in response to this petition. At the annual SAE Government-Industry Meeting in January 2017, NHTSA requested that SAE develop Recommended Procedures for test protocols and performance criteria for CMS that would replace mirror systems on light vehicles in the U.S. market. SAE assigned the task to the Driver Vision Committee, and the SAE Driver Vision Committee created a CMS Task Force to draft the Recommended Procedures. NHTSA published a report dated October 2018 related to camera monitoring systems for outside mirror replacements.  On October 10, 2019, an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) was published seeking public comment on permitting camera-based rear visibility systems, as an alternative to inside and outside rearview mirrors required under Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) No. 111, “Rear Visibility,” which currently requires that vehicles be equipped with rearview mirrors to provide drivers with a view of objects that are to their side or to their side and rear. This ANPRM builds on NHTSA's prior efforts to obtain supporting technical information, data, and analysis on CMS so that the agency can determine whether these systems can provide the same level of safety as the rearview mirrors currently required under FMVSS No. 111. The ANPRM states that one reason NHTSA is seeking additional information is because research conducted by NHTSA and others between 2006 and 2017 has consistently shown that prototype and preproduction camera-based rear visibility systems can exhibit safety-relevant performance issues.  In November 2022, NHTSA conducted a public meeting and discussed the on-going research of this technology.In July 2016, a revision to UN-ECE Regulation 46 was published with an effective date of June 18, 2016, which allows for camera monitor systems to replace mirrors within Japan and European countries. Since January 2017, camera monitoring systems are also permitted as an alternative to replace mirrors in the Korean market.  China has now released an updated version of its GB15084, which will be effective later in 2023, and allows for camera 11monitoring systems, frameless mirrors and aspheric (free-form) glass surfaces.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company continues to believe rearview mirrors provide a robust, simple and cost effective means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and remain the primary safety function for rear vision today.  Cameras, when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism, have some inherent limitations such as: electrical failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angle of the camera.  Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imagers and video displays as well.  The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors provides a more robust product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver.  The Company has been in production with the Company's Full Display Mirror® since 2015 and has, in the ordinary course of business, been awarded programs with fourteen (14) OEM customers. The Company is currently shipping production Full Display Mirrors® to all fourteen of these customers. In 2022, the Company began shipping Full Display Mirror® on 18 new nameplates and are currently shipping Full Display Mirror® on 86 nameplates. The Company's CMS solution uses three cameras to provide a comprehensive view of the sides and rear of the vehicle while still providing the traditional safety of interior and exterior mirrors, that still function when cameras are obstructed, or not functioning. The Company has previously announced that the Company continues to develop in the areas of imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens design, image processing from the camera to the display, and camera lens cleaning. The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving, there could be increased competition.Supply Chain Disruptions. As a result of just-in-time supply chains within our business and the automotive industry, disruptions in our supply chain have occurred, are occurring, and are expected to continue to occur due to the industry-wide parts shortages, labor shortages, and other global supply chain constraints. We have and continue to take a number of steps to mitigate the current supply chain challenges, which include strategies involving the additional procurement of available raw materials to prepare for assembling finished goods more quickly when supply constraints ease for certain common components. These inventory strategies further introduce obsolescence risk that impacts our business, financial conditions, and/or results of operations. As our customers' forecasted demand changes, inventory becomes obsolete and write-offs or write-downs of our inventory are exacerbated. Disruptions can also occur due to natural disasters, other pandemics, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. Such circumstances have disrupted, are disrupting, and will continue to disrupt our shipments to automakers and Tier 1 customers, which adversely affects our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Workforce Disruptions. We have experienced, and may continue to experience in the future, disruptions to our workforce as a result of a tight labor market, employee illness, quarantines, absenteeism, and restrictions on certain of our employee's ability to work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impacts of continued disruptions to our workforce have affected, are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Product Mix.  We sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell and to which customers, during a given period. The automotive industry is subject to rapid technological change, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and cyclical, ever-changing consumer demand patterns. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products.  As a result of such changes and circumstances impacting our customers, our sales mix can shift, which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth, in OEM sales demand, as well as in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases, and content penetration. A decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided higher value content could have a significant effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Our forward guidance and estimates assume a certain geographic sales mix as well as a product sales mix. When actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations are impacted.  Business Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, have resources available for or obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses.  Additionally, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, achieving projected synergies, and/or maximizing the value of acquired technologies and businesses. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate already exists and may increase, thereby potentially increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.12Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors, variable dimmable devices, certain electronics, and fire protection products, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Lack of intellectual property protection in a number of countries, including China, represents a current and ongoing risk for the Company. New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest significantly in engineering, research and development projects. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  If a person or company claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly, time consuming, and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our ongoing business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.  The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company.  Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Credit Risk. Certain automakers and Tier 1 customers from time to time may consider the sale of certain business segments or bankruptcy as a result of financial stress.  Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The current economic environment continues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact the timeliness of customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables. Our allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed automotive mirror and electronics customers.  We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances.  Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed primarily at our manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other primary manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services could be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these risks. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.IT Infrastructure and Cybersecurity.  A failure of our information technology (""IT"") infrastructure could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our business over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward. Like many systems, these systems may not always perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in, or otherwise compromise of, our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm.  We, and certain of our third-party vendors, receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, 13unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and/or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.Government Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These requirements necessitate due diligence efforts, and the Company has disclosed its findings annually to the SEC on Form SD around May 30 each year since 2012. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals necessary for our products, the Company cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.On December 8, 2015, NHTSA proposed changes to the Administration’s 5-Star Safety Ratings for new vehicles (also known as the New Car Assessment Program or NCAP) and initiated a comment period. The proposed changes will, for the first time, encompass assessment of crash-avoidance technologies, which includes lower beam headlamp performance, semi-automatic headlamp switching, and blind spot detection. NHTSA originally intended to implement the enhancements in NCAP in 2018 beginning with model year 2019 vehicles. The NCAP implementation has been delayed. Under these proposed changes, the Company believes that its SmartBeam® technology will qualify with the semi-automatic headlamp NCAP rating system, and that its SmartBeam® technology and exterior mirrors with blind spot alert lighting can be included in a system that qualifies with the lower beam headlamp performance and blind spot detection NCAP rating system, respectively. On October 16, 2019, NHTSA issued a press release comparing NCAP to other regions’ version of NCAP, identified new technologies that are not currently included in NCAP, and suggested Congress legislatively direct actions to improve NCAP.  On January 14, 2021, NHTSA issued a request for comment regarding NCAP with advanced driver assist features, including forward collision, lane keeping, blind spot detection and forward pedestrian impact avoidance technologies.  On October 12, 2018, NHTSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""NPRM"") for amendments to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (""FMVSS"") No. 108: Lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment, and initiated a comment period. The NPRM proposes amendments that would permit the certification of adaptive driving beam head-lighting systems, if the manufacturer chooses to equip vehicles with these systems. NHTSA proposes to establish appropriate performance requirements to ensure the safe introduction of adaptive driving beam head-lighting systems if equipped on newly manufactured vehicles. The Company believes that its dynamic SmartBeam® lighting control system (dynamic forward lighting or DFL), which has been sold in markets outside of North America for several years, will meet the requirements of the new FMVSS No. 108 standards, if amended. The Company's SmartBeam® application has and will continue to be affected by increased competition suppliers of multi-function driver assist camera products, which are able to achieve some of the same functionality as SmartBeam® but at a lower cost, due to other suppliers leveraging similar hardware costs, but offering products with multiple software features.As noted, on October 10, 2019, an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""ANPRM"") was published seeking public comment on permitting camera-based rear visibility systems, as an alternative to inside and outside rearview mirrors required under FMVSS No. 111, “Rear Visibility,” which currently requires that vehicles be equipped with rearview mirrors to provide drivers with a view of objects that are to their side or to their side and rear. This ANPRM builds on NHTSA's prior efforts to obtain supporting technical information, data, and analysis on CMS so that the agency can determine whether these systems can provide the same level of safety as the rearview mirrors currently required under FMVSS No. 111. The ANPRM states that one reason NHTSA is seeking additional information is because research conducted by NHTSA and others between 2006 and 2017 has consistently shown that prototype and preproduction camera-based rear visibility systems can exhibit safety-relevant performance issues. In November 2022, NHTSA conducted a public meeting and discussed the ongoing research of this technology.14On February 1, 2022, NHTSA signed a Final Rule to allow for adaptive driving beam headlights, and the Final Rule is awaiting publication in the Federal Registrar.  The Company believes its adaptive SmartBeam® (dynamic lighting system), which has been manufactured and sold for many years in jurisdictions outside the United States, will be permitted under the NHTSA Final Rule. Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of the state of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low closing price of $23.80 to a high closing price of $36.18 during calendar year 2022. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock relating to the issues discussed above or due to any of the following:•Variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;•Changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;•Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims or other litigation;•The size of the public float of our common stock;•Market conditions, including the industry in which we operate; and•General macroeconomic conditions.General Risk Factors
COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has already significantly impacted worldwide economic and industry conditions and has had, is having, and is expected to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The extent and duration of such possible impacts will depend on numerous factors, including:•Duration and severity of any outbreaks and resulting actions taken by the Company or the various governments to contain or mitigate the spread of the coronavirus;•Global governmental, business and individual actions taken in response to COVID-19, such as work stoppages, quarantines, shutdowns, shelter-in-place orders or other limitations, as well as voluntary shutdowns and other restrictions;•The effect on our suppliers and companies throughout our supply chain, including industry wide part shortages and created labor shortages;•Our ability to fulfill existing and future sales order backlog;•Reductions or volatility in demand for our products or services;•Increasing logistics costs and transportation challenges;•Costs of any additional preparedness plans or actions to help ensure the health and safety of our employees and continued operations;•Availability of employees to staff our operations and those of companies in our supply chain;•Our ability to establish and maintain appropriate estimates and assumptions used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements; and•The financial and credit markets and economic activity generally, all of which have harmed and could continue to harm our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations, including impacting the ability to access capital and comply with any financial covenants.Income Taxes. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform United States and foreign tax laws could adversely affect the Company's operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. The Company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Employees. Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Throughout our Company, our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill sets and experience and a skilled workforce could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in, and low 15unemployment has contributed to, increased turnover. Turnover, inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, or government mandated remote work has had, is having, and is expected to continue to have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.International Operations.  We currently conduct operations in various countries and jurisdictions, including purchasing raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world, which subjects us to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements as well as various economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Some of these countries are considered growth markets. International sales and operations, especially in growth markets, subject us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:•Exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions;•     Unexpected changes in laws, regulations, trade or monetary or fiscal policy, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the U.S. and other foreign countries;•    Tariffs (as discussed herein), quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers;•Natural disasters, political crises, and public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), which have caused, are causing, and will likely continue to cause downtime and closures at both supplier and customer facilities;•Brexit, and its impact; •Expropriation and nationalization;•    Difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;•     Reduced intellectual property protection;•Withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;•    Investment restrictions or requirements;•     Export and import restrictions;•     Violence and civil unrest in local countries;•    Compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of various other countries; and•Exposure related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include:•Rising commodity prices and inflation generally, where we are unable to recover such increases from customers;•Increasing interest rates impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments and/or recognized losses due to a corresponding impairment adjustment on investment securities and can impact customer demand as well;•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, trade war, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels, thereby impacting the Company;•Manufacturing yield issues; and•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims.16"

These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: changes in general industry or regional market conditions; changes in consumer and customer preferences for our products (such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving); our ability to be awarded new business; continued uncertainty in pricing negotiations with customers; loss of business from increased competition; changes in strategic relationships; customer bankruptcies or divestiture of customer brands; fluctuation in vehicle production schedules (including the impact of customer employee strikes); changes in product mix; raw material and other supply shortages; labor shortages, supply chain constraints and disruptions; our dependence on information systems; higher raw material, fuel, energy and other costs; unfavorable fluctuations in currencies or interest rates in the regions in which we operate; costs or difficulties related to the integration and/or ability to maximize the value of any new or acquired technologies and businesses; changes in regulatory conditions; warranty and recall claims and other litigation and customer reactions thereto; possible adverse results of pending or future litigation or infringement claims; changes in tax laws; import and export duty and tariff rates in or with the countries with which we conduct business; negative impact of any governmental investigations and associated litigation including securities litigation relating to the conduct of our business; the length and severity of the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, including its impact across our business on demand, operations, and the global supply chain, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) vaccine mandate, currently in the rule making process, that would require employees to be either vaccinated or tested weekly if the employee is unvaccinated. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made.The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Accordingly, any forward-looking statement should be read in conjunction with the additional information about risks and uncertainties identified under the heading “Risk Factors
” in the Company’s latest Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, which risks and uncertainties now include the impacts of COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic and supply chain constraints that have affected, are affecting, and will continue to affect, 9general economic and industry conditions, customers, suppliers, and the regulatory environment in which the Company operates. Includes content supplied by IHS Markit Light Vehicle Production Forecast of January 17, 2022 (http://www.gentex.com/forecast-disclaimer).The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. Customers within the auto industry comprise approximately 97% of our net sales. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment continues to be uncertain, and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile automotive production levels, volatility with customer orders, supplier part and material shortages (especially electronics components), automotive and Tier 1 supplier plant shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues, commodity raw material cost increases, supply constraints, tariffs, consumer vehicle preference shifts (where we have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle), and supply chain stresses, all of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the fallout therefrom. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience additional plant shutdowns, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it will further disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs on time, due in part to continued vehicle complexity increases and supply chain constraints.  This has increased the risk of  delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts. This makes it challenging for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments, in addition to the aforementioned factors.  Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including three automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2021 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, and General Motors.  The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Pricing Pressures. We continue to experience on-going pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, increases in unit shipments of mirrors and electronics with advanced features, and/or new or advanced technologies, each of which pose an ongoing challenge, which could continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Tariffs.  The geopolitical environment between the Unites States and other jurisdictions, including China and the European Union, continues to cause uncertainty on tariffs and trade. Starting in 2018, and throughout calendar year 2019, the United States enacted new tariffs on numerous raw materials that the Company imports from China, and likewise China also enacted retaliatory tariffs on the finished goods that the Company imports into China for distribution and sale in the China market.  Such tariffs have increased the Company's input costs, and have the potential to challenge the Company's competitive position in foreign markets. The continuance of these tariffs and/or escalation of disputes in the geopolitical environment could continue to interfere with automotive supply chains and may have a continued negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and/or results of operations, especially since the Company primarily manufactures and ships from one location. We cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other governments, and any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could have a further adverse impact on our business. Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat. Additionally, other companies have demonstrated products that are competitive to our Full Display Mirror® system and other products.  We acknowledge that dimming device (e.g., electrochromic) technology is the subject of research and development efforts by numerous third parties. For example, our SmartBeam® product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products has already and could continue to impact the success of SmartBeam®. 10On March 31, 2014 the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (""NHTSA"") to allow automakers to use camera monitoring systems (""CMS"") as an option to replace conventional rearview mirrors within North America, however, no final rule or legislation was made in response to this petition. At the annual SAE Government-Industry Meeting in January 2017, NHTSA requested that SAE develop Recommended Procedures for test protocols and performance criteria for CMS that would replace mirror systems on light vehicles in the U.S. market. SAE assigned the task to the Driver Vision Committee, and the SAE Driver Vision Committee created a CMS Task Force to draft the Recommended Procedures. NHTSA published a report dated October 2018 related to camera monitoring systems for outside mirror replacements.  On October 10, 2019, an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) was published seeking public comment on permitting camera-based rear visibility systems, as an alternative to inside and outside rearview mirrors required under Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) No. 111, “Rear Visibility,” which currently requires that vehicles be equipped with rearview mirrors to provide drivers with a view of objects that are to their side or to their side and rear. This ANPRM builds on NHTSA's prior efforts to obtain supporting technical information, data, and analysis on CMS so that the agency can determine whether these systems can provide the same level of safety as the rearview mirrors currently required under FMVSS No. 111. The ANPRM states that one reason NHTSA is seeking additional information is because research conducted by NHTSA and others between 2006 and 2017 has consistently shown that prototype and preproduction camera-based rear visibility systems can exhibit safety-relevant performance issues.On October 18, 2019, a petition for temporary exemption from FMVSS No. 111 submitted by Audi of America was published requesting NHTSA to grant a two-year exemption to sell up to 2,500 vehicles for each twelve month period (up to 5,000 vehicles) that are equipped with camera monitoring systems and do not include FMVSS No. 111 compliant outside mirrors.In July 2016, a revision to UN-ECE Regulation 46 was published with an effective date of June 18, 2016, which allows for camera monitor systems to replace mirrors within Japan and European countries. Since January 2017, camera monitoring systems are also permitted as an alternative to replace mirrors in the Korean market.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company continues to believe rearview mirrors provide a robust, simple and cost effective means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and remain the primary safety function for rear vision today.  Cameras, when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism, have some inherent limitations such as: electrical failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angle of the camera.  Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imagers and video displays as well.  The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors provides a more robust product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver.  The Company has been in production with the Company's Full Display Mirror® since 2015 and has, in the ordinary course of business, been awarded programs with fourteen (14) OEM customers. The Company is currently shipping production Full Display Mirrors® to eleven automaker customers. The Company's CMS solution uses three cameras to provide a comprehensive view of the sides and rear of the vehicle while still providing the traditional safety of interior and exterior mirrors, that still function when cameras are obstructed, or not functioning. The Company announced the CMS development program with Aston Martin. The Company has also previously announced that the Company continues to develop in the areas of imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens design, image processing from the camera to the display, and camera lens cleaning. The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving, there could be increased competition.Supply Chain Disruptions. As a result of just-in-time supply chains within our business and the automotive industry, disruptions in our supply chain have occurred, are occurring, and are expected to continue to occur due to the COVID-19 pandemic, industry-wide parts shortages, labor shortages, and other global supply chain constraints. Disruptions can also occur due to natural disasters, other pandemics, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. Such circumstances have disrupted, are disrupting, and will continue to disrupt our shipments to automakers and Tier 1 customers, which adversely affects our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Workforce Disruptions. We are also experiencing and expect to continue to experience increased disruptions to our workforce as a result of employee illness, quarantines, absenteeism, and restrictions on certain of our employee's ability to work as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The impacts of continued disruptions to our workforce have affected, are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. 11Product Mix.  We sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell and to which customers, during a given period. The automotive industry is subject to rapid technological change, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and cyclical, ever-changing consumer demand patterns. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products.  As a result of such changes and circumstances impacting our customers, sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth, in OEM sales demand, as well as in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration.  A decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided higher value content could have a significant effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Our forward guidance and estimates assume a certain geographic sales mix as well as a product sales mix. When actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations are impacted.  Business Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, have resources available for or obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses.  Additionally, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, achieving projected synergies, and/or maximizing the value of acquired technologies and businesses. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate already exists and may increase, thereby potentially increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors, variable dimmable devices, certain electronics, and fire protection products, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Lack of intellectual property protection in a number of countries, including China, represents a current and on-going risk for the Company. New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest significantly in engineering, research and development projects. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  If a person or company claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly, time consuming, and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our on-going business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.  The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company.  Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Credit Risk. Certain automakers and Tier 1 customers from time to time may consider the sale of certain business segments or bankruptcy as a result of financial stress.  Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The current economic environment continues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact the timeliness of customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables. Our allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed automotive mirror and electronics customers.  We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances.  Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed at our manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. 12Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services could be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these risks. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.IT Infrastructure and Cybersecurity.  A failure of our information technology (""IT"") infrastructure could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our businesses over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward. These systems may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. We maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. While these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in, or otherwise compromise of, our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result in significant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm.  We, and certain of our third-party vendors, receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and/or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.Government Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These requirements necessitate due diligence efforts, and the Company has disclosed its findings annually to the SEC on Form SD around May 30 each year since 2012. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals necessary for our products, the Company cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.On December 8, 2015, NHTSA proposed changes to the Administration’s 5-Star Safety Ratings for new vehicles (also known as the New Car Assessment Program or NCAP) and initiated a comment period. The proposed changes will, for the first time, encompass assessment of crash-avoidance technologies, which includes lower beam headlamp performance, semi-automatic headlamp switching, and blind spot detection. NHTSA originally intended to implement the enhancements in NCAP in 2018 beginning with model year 2019 vehicles. The NCAP implementation has been delayed. Under these proposed changes, the Company believes that its SmartBeam® technology will qualify with the semi-automatic headlamp NCAP rating system, and that its SmartBeam® technology and exterior mirrors with blind spot alert lighting can be included in a system that qualifies with the lower beam headlamp performance and blind spot detection NCAP rating system, respectively. On October 16, 2019, NHTSA issued a press release comparing NCAP to other regions’ version of NCAP, identified new technologies that are not currently included in NCAP, and suggested Congress legislatively direct actions to improve NCAP.  On January 14, 2021, NHTSA issued a request for comment regarding NCAP with advanced driver assist features, including forward collision, lane keeping, blind spot detection and forward pedestrian impact avoidance technologies.  13On October 12, 2018, NHTSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""NPRM"") for amendments to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (""FMVSS"") No. 108: Lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment, and initiated a comment period. The NPRM proposes amendments that would permit the certification of adaptive driving beam head-lighting systems, if the manufacturer chooses to equip vehicles with these systems. NHTSA proposes to establish appropriate performance requirements to ensure the safe introduction of adaptive driving beam head-lighting systems if equipped on newly manufactured vehicles. The Company believes that its dynamic SmartBeam® lighting control system (dynamic forward lighting or DFL), which has been sold in markets outside of North America for several years, will meet the requirements of the new FMVSS No. 108 standards, if amended. The Company's SmartBeam® application has and will continue to be affected by increased competition suppliers of multi-function driver assist camera products, which are able to achieve some of the same functionality as SmartBeam® but at a lower cost, due to other suppliers leveraging similar hardware costs, but offering products with multiple software features.As noted, on October 10, 2019, an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""ANPRM"") was published seeking public comment on permitting camera-based rear visibility systems, as an alternative to inside and outside rearview mirrors required under FMVSS No. 111, “Rear Visibility,” which currently requires that vehicles be equipped with rearview mirrors to provide drivers with a view of objects that are to their side or to their side and rear. This ANPRM builds on NHTSA's prior efforts to obtain supporting technical information, data, and analysis on CMS so that the agency can determine whether these systems can provide the same level of safety as the rearview mirrors currently required under FMVSS No. 111. The ANPRM states that one reason NHTSA is seeking additional information is because research conducted by NHTSA and others between 2006 and 2017 has consistently shown that prototype and preproduction camera-based rear visibility systems can exhibit safety-relevant performance issues.On February 1, 2022, NHTSA signed a Final Rule to allow for adaptive driving beam headlights, and the Final Rule is awaiting publication in the Federal Registrar.  The Company believes its adaptive SmartBeam® (dynamic lighting system), which has been manufactured and sold for many years in jurisdictions outside the United States, will be permitted under the NHTSA Final Rule. Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of the state of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low closing price of $30.40 to a high closing price of $37.90 during calendar year 2021. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock relating to the issues discussed above or due to any of the following:•Variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;•Changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;•Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims;•The size of the public float of our common stock;•Market conditions, including the industry in which we operate; and•General macroeconomic conditions.General Risk Factors
COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has already significantly impacted worldwide economic and industry conditions and has had, is having, and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic began to materially impact the Company's operations late in the first quarter of 2020 and continues to affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations, by virtue of governmental authorities imposing mandatory closures, work-from-home orders, and social distancing protocols, as well as voluntary closures and other restrictions. Even as restrictions have eased and production has resumed by our customers in large part, production volumes have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted supply chains, including industry wide part shortages and created labor shortages as discussed.The full extent of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, our customers, our supply chain, and our industries still depends on future developments, which remain highly uncertain, including the duration and severity 14of the current outbreak, subsequent outbreaks, and resulting actions taken by the Company or the various governments to contain or mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. These actions have already included, and could include more, work stoppages, quarantines, shutdowns, shelter-in-place orders or other limitations, which already have and could continue to: materially adversely affect the Company's ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations; impair our ability to sustain existing levels of financial liquidity; and impact the Company's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Additionally, if the negative global economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continue, overall customer demand may decrease, which could continue to have a material and adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. While we cannot predict the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic and its fallout, the overall negative financial impact to the Company's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations has been material, is not fully known, and is expected to continue for an extended period of time.Income Taxes. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform United States and foreign tax laws could adversely affect the Company's operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. The Company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Employees. Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Throughout our Company, our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill sets and experience and a skilled workforce could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in, and low unemployment has contributed to, increased turnover. The Company experienced higher than traditional absenteeism rates in 2021 and the beginning of calendar year 2022 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the more contagious omicron variant.  Turnover, inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, or government mandated remote work has had, is having, and is expected to continue to have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.International Operations.  We currently conduct operations in various countries and jurisdictions, including purchasing raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world, which subjects us to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements as well as various economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Some of these countries are considered growth markets. International sales and operations, especially in growth markets, subject us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:•Exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions;•     Unexpected changes in laws, regulations, trade or monetary or fiscal policy, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the U.S. and other foreign countries;•    Tariffs (as discussed herein), quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers;•Natural disasters, political crises, and public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), which have caused, are causing, and will likely continue to cause downtime and closures at both supplier and customer facilities;•Brexit, and its impact; •Expropriation and nationalization;•    Difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;•     Reduced intellectual property protection;•Withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;•    Investment restrictions or requirements;•     Export and import restrictions;•     Violence and civil unrest in local countries;•    Compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of various other countries; and•Exposure related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include:15•Volatility in commodity prices adversely affects our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  When commodity prices rise and we are unable to recover such cost increases from our customers, those increases have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations;•Increasing interest rates impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments and/or recognized losses due to a corresponding impairment adjustment on investment securities and can impact customer demand as well;•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, trade war, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels;•Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations; and•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.16"

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Accordingly, any forward-looking statement should be read in conjunction with the additional information about risks and uncertainties identified under the heading “Risk Factors
” in the Company’s latest Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC, which risks and uncertainties now include the impacts of COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic that has affected, and will continue to affect, general economic and industry conditions, customers, suppliers, and the regulatory environment in which the Company operates. Includes content supplied by IHS Markit Light Vehicle Production Forecast of January 18, 2021 (http://www.gentex.com/forecast-disclaimer).The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry.  Customers within the auto industry comprise approximately 98% of our net sales. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment continues to be uncertain, and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile automotive production levels (including continued decreases in light vehicle production in China), volatility with customer orders, supplier part and material shortages, automotive and Tier 1 supplier plant shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues, commodity material cost increases and/or supply constraints, tariffs, consumer vehicle preference shifts (where we may have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle), and supply chain stresses, all of which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience plant shutdowns, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs on time, due in part to continued vehicle complexity increases, which can result in delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts. This makes it challenging for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments, in addition to the aforementioned factors.  Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including three automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2020 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, and General Motors.  The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Pricing Pressures. We continue to experience on-going pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, increases in unit shipments of mirrors and electronics with advanced features, and/or new or advanced technologies, each of which pose an ongoing challenge, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.8Tariffs.  The geo-political environment between the Unites States and other jurisdictions, including China and the European Union, continues to cause uncertainty on tariffs and trade. Starting in 2018, and throughout calendar year 2019, the United States enacted new tariffs on numerous raw materials that the Company imports from China, and likewise China also enacted retaliatory tariffs on the finished goods that the Company imports into China for distribution and sale in the China market.  Such tariffs have increased the Company's input costs, and have the potential to challenge the Company's competitive position in foreign markets. The continuance of these tariffs and/or escalation of disputes in the geopolitical environment could continue to interfere with automotive supply chains and may have a continued negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and/or results of operations, especially since the Company primarily manufactures and ships from one location. We cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other governments, and any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business. Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat. Additionally, other companies have demonstrated products that are competitive to our Full Display Mirror® system and other products.  We acknowledge that dimming device (e.g., electrochromic) technology is the subject of research and development efforts by numerous third parties. For example, our SmartBeam® product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products has already and could continue to impact the success of SmartBeam®. On March 31, 2014 the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (""NHTSA"") to allow automakers to use camera monitoring systems (""CMS"") as an option to replace conventional rearview mirrors within North America, however, no final rule or legislation was made in response to this petition. At the annual SAE Government-Industry Meeting in January 2017, NHTSA requested that SAE develop Recommended Procedures for test protocols and performance criteria for CMS that would replace mirror systems on light vehicles in the U.S. market. SAE assigned the task to the Driver Vision Committee, and the SAE Driver Vision Committee created a CMS Task Force to draft the Recommended Procedures. NHTSA published a report dated October 2018 related to camera monitoring systems for outside mirror replacements.  On October 10, 2019, an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) was published seeking public comment on permitting camera-based rear visibility systems, as an alternative to inside and outside rearview mirrors required under Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) No. 111, “Rear Visibility,” which currently requires that vehicles be equipped with rearview mirrors to provide drivers with a view of objects that are to their side or to their side and rear. This ANPRM builds on NHTSA's prior efforts to obtain supporting technical information, data, and analysis on CMS so that the agency can determine whether these systems can provide the same level of safety as the rearview mirrors currently required under FMVSS No. 111. The ANPRM states that one reason NHTSA is seeking additional information is because research conducted by NHTSA and others between 2006 and 2017 has consistently shown that prototype and preproduction camera-based rear visibility systems can exhibit safety-relevant performance issues.On October 18, 2019, a petition for temporary exemption from FMVSS No. 111 submitted by Audi of America was published requesting NHTSA to grant a two-year exemption to sell up to 2,500 vehicles for each twelve month period (up to 5,000 vehicles) that are equipped with camera monitoring systems and do not include FMVSS No. 111 compliant outside mirrors.In July 2016, a revision to UN-ECE Regulation 46 was published with an effective date of June 18, 2016, which allows for camera monitor systems to replace mirrors within Japan and European countries. Since January 2017, camera monitoring systems are also permitted as an alternative to replace mirrors in the Korean market.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company continues to believe rearview mirrors provide a robust, simple and cost effective means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and remain the primary safety function for rear vision today.  Cameras, when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism, have some inherent limitations such as: electrical failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angle of the camera.  Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imagers and video displays as well.  The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors provides a more robust product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver.  The Company has been in production with the Company's Full Display Mirror® since 2015 and has been awarded programs with ten (10) OEM customers. The Company is currently shipping production Full Display Mirrors® to eight 9automaker customers, which are General Motors, Subaru, Toyota, Nissan, Jaguar Land Rover, Mitsubishi, Aston Martin, and FCA. The Company's CMS solution uses three cameras to provide a comprehensive view of the sides and rear of the vehicle while still providing the traditional safety of interior and exterior mirrors, that still function when cameras are obstructed, or not functioning. The Company announced the CMS development program with Aston Martin. The Company has also previously announced that the Company continues to develop in the areas of imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens design, image processing from the camera to the display, and camera lens cleaning. The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving, there could be increased competition.Product Mix.  We sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell and to which customers, during a given period. The automotive industry is subject to rapid technological change, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and cyclical, ever-changing consumer demand patterns. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products.  As a result of such changes and circumstances impacting our customers, sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth, in OEM sales demand, as well as in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration.  A decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided higher value content could have a significant effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Our forward guidance and estimates assume a certain geographic sales mix as well as a product sales mix. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Business Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, have resources available for or obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses.  Additionally, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, achieving projected synergies, and/or maximizing the value of acquired technologies and businesses. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate already exists and may increase, thereby potentially increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors, variable dimmable devices, certain electronics, and fire protection products, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Lack of intellectual property protection in a number of countries, including China, represents a current and on-going risk for the Company. New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest significantly in engineering, research and development projects. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  If a person or company claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly, time consuming, and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues.  The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our on-going business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.  The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company.  Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Credit Risk. Certain automakers and Tier 1 customers from time to time may consider the sale of certain business segments or bankruptcy as a result of financial stress.  Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The current economic environment 10continues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact the timeliness of customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables. Our allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed automotive mirror and electronics customers.  We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances.  Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.Supply Chain Disruptions. As a result of just-in-time supply chains within our business and the automotive industry, disruptions in our supply chain are occurring due to the COVID-19 pandemic and can also occur due to natural disasters, other pandemics, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. Such circumstances are disrupting, and may further disrupt, our shipments to one or more automakers or Tier 1 customers, which adversely affects our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed at our manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services could be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these risks. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.IT Infrastructure.  A failure of our information technology (""IT"") infrastructure could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our businesses over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward.  These systems may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We, and certain of our third-party vendors, receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.   Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.Government Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, and the Company has disclosed its findings annually to the SEC on Form SD around May 30 each year. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals necessary for our products, the Company cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.The European New Car Assessment Program (""Euro NCAP"") provides an incentive for automobiles sold in Europe to apply safety technologies that include driver assist features such as lane detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection as standard equipment. Euro NCAP compliant driver assist systems are also capable of including high beam assist as a function. The increased application of Euro NCAP on European vehicles has impacted and could continue to impact take rates for the Company's SmartBeam® application on these vehicles. 11On December 8, 2015, NHTSA proposed changes to the Administration’s 5-Star Safety Ratings for new vehicles (also known as the New Car Assessment Program or NCAP) and initiated a comment period. The proposed changes will, for the first time, encompass assessment of crash-avoidance technologies, which includes lower beam headlamp performance, semi-automatic headlamp switching, and blind spot detection. NHTSA originally intended to implement the enhancements in NCAP in 2018 beginning with model year 2019 vehicles. The NCAP implementation has been delayed. Under these proposed changes, the Company believes that its SmartBeam® technology will qualify with the semi-automatic headlamp NCAP rating system, and that its SmartBeam® technology and exterior mirrors with blind spot alert lighting can be included in a system that qualifies with the lower beam headlamp performance and blind spot detection NCAP rating system, respectively. On October 16, 2019, NHTSA issued a press release comparing NCAP to other regions’ version of NCAP, identified new technologies that are not currently included in NCAP, and suggested Congress legislatively direct actions to improve NCAP.  On January 14, 2021, NHTSA issued a request for comment regarding NCAP with advanced driver assist features, including forward collision, lane keeping, blind spot detection and forward pedestrian impact avoidance technologies.  On October 12, 2018, NHTSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""NPRM"") for amendments to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (""FMVSS"") No. 108: Lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment, and initiated a comment period. The NPRM proposes amendments that would permit the certification of adaptive driving beam head-lighting systems, if the manufacturer chooses to equip vehicles with these systems. NHTSA proposes to establish appropriate performance requirements to ensure the safe introduction of adaptive driving beam head-lighting systems if equipped on newly manufactured vehicles. The Company believes that its dynamic SmartBeam® lighting control system (dynamic forward lighting or DFL), which has been sold in markets outside of North America for several years, will meet the requirements of the new FMVSS No. 108 standards, if amended. The Company's SmartBeam® application has and will continue to be affected by increased competition suppliers of multi-function driver assist camera products, which are able to achieve some of the same functionality as SmartBeam® but at a lower cost, due to other suppliers leveraging similar hardware costs, but offering products with multiple software features.As noted, on October 10, 2019, an ANPRM was published seeking public comment on permitting camera-based rear visibility systems, as an alternative to inside and outside rearview mirrors required under FMVSS No. 111, “Rear Visibility,” which currently requires that vehicles be equipped with rearview mirrors to provide drivers with a view of objects that are to their side or to their side and rear. This ANPRM builds on NHTSA's prior efforts to obtain supporting technical information, data, and analysis on CMS so that the agency can determine whether these systems can provide the same level of safety as the rearview mirrors currently required under FMVSS No. 111. The ANPRM states that one reason NHTSA is seeking additional information is because research conducted by NHTSA and others between 2006 and 2017 has consistently shown that prototype and preproduction camera-based rear visibility systems can exhibit safety-relevant performance issues.Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of the state of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low closing price of $20.09 to a high closing price of $34.06 during calendar year 2020. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock relating to the issues discussed above or due to any of the following:•Variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;•Changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;•Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims;•The size of the public float of our common stock;•Market conditions, including the industry in which we operate; and•General macroeconomic conditions.General Risk Factors
COVID-19 Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has already significantly impacted worldwide economic and industry conditions and has had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial 12condition, and/or results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic began to materially impact the Company's operations late in the first quarter of 2020 and continues to affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations, by virtue of governmental authorities imposing mandatory closures, work-from-home orders, and social distancing protocols, as well as voluntary closures and other restrictions. Even as restrictions have eased and production has resumed by our customers in large part, production volumes have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile.The full extent of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, our customers, our supply chain, and our industries still depends on future developments, which remain highly uncertain, including the duration and severity of the current outbreak, subsequent outbreaks, and resulting actions taken by the Company or the various governments to contain or mitigate the spread of the coronavirus. These actions have already included, and could include more, work stoppages, quarantines, shutdowns, shelter-in-place orders or other limitations, which already have and could continue to: materially adversely affect the Company's ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations; impair our ability to sustain existing levels of financial liquidity; and impact the Company's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Additionally, if the negative global economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continue, overall customer demand may decrease, which could continue to have a material and adverse effect on the Company's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. While we cannot predict the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall negative financial impact to the Company's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations has been material, is not fully known, and is expected to last for an extended period of time.Income Taxes. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform United States and foreign tax laws could adversely affect the Company's operating results, cash flows, and financial condition. The Company’s domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions. Employees.  Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Throughout our Company, our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill sets and experience and a skilled workforce could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in, and low unemployment generally can cause, increased turnover. In addition, any unplanned turnover, inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, or government mandated remote work could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.International Operations.  We currently conduct operations in various countries and jurisdictions, including purchasing raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world, which subjects us to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements as well as various economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Some of these countries are considered growth markets. International sales and operations, especially in growth markets, subject us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:•Exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions;•     Unexpected changes in laws, regulations, trade or monetary or fiscal policy, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the U.S. and other foreign countries;•    Tariffs (as discussed herein), quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers;•Natural disasters, political crises, and public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), which have caused and will likely continue to cause downtime and closures at both supplier and customer facilities;•Brexit, and its impact; •Expropriation and nationalization;•    Difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;•     Reduced intellectual property protection;•Withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;•    Investment restrictions or requirements;•     Export and import restrictions;•     Violence and civil unrest in local countries;13•    Compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of various other countries; and•Exposure related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include:•Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If commodity prices rise, and if we are unable to recover these cost increases from our customers, such increases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations;•Increasing interest rates impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments and/or recognized losses due to a corresponding impairment adjustment on investment securities;•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, trade war, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels;•Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations; and•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.14"

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market.  Forward-looking statements include content supplied by IHS Markit Light Vehicle Production Forecast (January 16, 2020) (http://www.gentex.com/ forecast-disclaimer).The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry.  Customers within the auto industry comprise approximately 97% of our net sales. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment, while perhaps relatively stable domestically, continues to be uncertain when considering the global automotive market, and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile automotive production levels (including continued decreases in light vehicle production in China), volatility with customer orders, supplier part and material shortages, automotive and Tier 1 supplier plant shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues, commodity material cost increases and/or supply constraints, tariffs, consumer vehicle preference shifts (where we may have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle), and supply chain stresses, all of which have been exacerbated by the coronavirus. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience plant shutdowns, work stoppages, strikes (such as the employee strike at General Motors in the fourth quarter of 2019, which negatively impacted revenue, gross margin, etc. in the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2019), part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/8or results of operations.  Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs on time, due in part to continued vehicle complexity increases, which can result in delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts. This makes it challenging for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments, in addition to the aforementioned factors.  Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including three automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2019 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, and General Motors.  The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Pricing Pressures. We continue to experience on-going pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, increases in unit shipments of mirrors and electronics with advanced features, and/or new or advanced technologies, each of which pose an ongoing challenge, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Tariffs.  The geo-political environment between the Unites States and other jurisdictions, including China and the European Union, continues to cause uncertainty on tariffs and trade. Starting in 2018, and throughout calendar year 2019, the United States enacted new tariffs on numerous raw materials that the Company imports from China, and likewise China also enacted retaliatory tariffs on the finished goods that the Company imports into China for distribution and sale in the China market.  Such tariffs increase the Company's input costs, and potentially challenge the Company's competitive position in the China market.  Even though in January 2020, the United States and China came to agreement on the first phase of a trade deal to halt tariff increases, uncertainty remains. The continuance of these tariffs and/or escalation of disputes in the geopolitical environment will continue to interfere with automotive supply chains and may have a continued negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat. Additionally, other companies have demonstrated products that are competitive to our Full Display Mirror® system and other products.  We acknowledge that dimming device (e.g., electrochromic) technology is the subject of research and development efforts by numerous third parties. For example, our SmartBeam® product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products has already and could continue to impact the success of SmartBeam®. On March 31, 2014 the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (""NHTSA"") to allow automakers to use camera monitoring systems (""CMS"") as an option to replace conventional rearview mirrors within North America, however, no final rule or legislation was made in response to this petition. At the annual SAE Government-Industry Meeting in January 2017, NHTSA requested that SAE develop Recommended Procedures for test protocols and performance criteria for CMS that would replace mirror systems on light vehicles in the U.S. market. SAE assigned the task to the Driver Vision Committee, and the SAE Driver Vision Committee created a CMS Task Force to draft the Recommended Procedures. NHTSA published a report dated October 2018 related to camera monitoring systems for outside mirror replacements.  On October 10, 2019, an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) was published seeking public comment on permitting camera-based rear visibility systems, as an alternative to inside and outside rearview mirrors required under Federal motor vehicle safety standard (FMVSS) No. 111, “Rear Visibility,” which currently requires that vehicles be equipped with rearview mirrors to provide drivers with a view of objects that are to their side or to their side and rear. This ANPRM builds on NHTSA's prior efforts to obtain supporting technical information, data, and analysis on CMS so that the agency can determine whether these systems can provide the same level of safety as the rearview mirrors currently required under FMVSS No. 111. The ANPRM states that one reason NHTSA is seeking additional information is because research conducted by NHTSA and others between 2006 and 2017 has consistently shown that prototype and preproduction camera-based rear visibility systems can exhibit safety-relevant performance issues.On October 18, 2019, a petition for temporary exemption from FMVSS No. 111 submitted by Audi of America was published requesting NHTSA to grant a two-year exemption to sell up to 2,500 vehicles for each twelve month period 9(up to 5,000 vehicles) that are equipped with camera monitoring systems and do not include FMVSS No. 111 compliant outside mirrors.In July 2016, a revision to UN-ECE Regulation 46 was published with an effective date of June 18, 2016, which allows for camera monitor systems to replace mirrors within Japan and European countries. Since January 2017, camera monitoring systems are also permitted as an alternative to replace mirrors in the Korean market.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company continues to believe rearview mirrors provide a robust, simple and cost effective means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and remain the primary safety function for rear vision today.  Cameras, when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism, have some inherent limitations such as: electrical failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angle of the camera.  Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imagers and video displays as well.  The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors provides a more robust product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver.  The Company has been in production with the Company's Full Display Mirror® since 2015 and has been awarded programs with ten (10) OEM customers. The Company is currently shipping production Full Display Mirrors® to five automaker customers, which are General Motors, Subaru, Toyota, Nissan, and Jaguar Land Rover. The Company's CMS solution uses three cameras to provide a comprehensive view of the sides and rear of the vehicle while still providing the traditional safety of interior and exterior mirrors, that still function when cameras are obstructed, or not functioning. The Company recently announced the CMS development program with Aston Martin. The Company has also previously announced that the Company continues to develop in the areas of imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens design, image processing from the camera to the display, and camera lens cleaning. The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving, there could be increased competition.Product Mix.  We sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell and to which customers, during a given period. The automotive industry is subject to rapid technological change, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and cyclical, ever-changing consumer demand patterns. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products.  As a result of such changes and circumstances impacting our customers, sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth, in OEM sales demand, as well as in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration.  A decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided higher value content could have a significant effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Our forward guidance and estimates assume a certain geographic sales mix as well as a product sales mix. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Business Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, have resources available for or obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses.  Additionally, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, achieving projected synergies, and/or maximizing the value of acquired technologies and businesses. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate already exists and may increase, thereby potentially increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors, variable dimmable windows, certain electronics, and fire protection products, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Lack of intellectual property protection in a number of countries, including China, represents a current and on-going risk for the Company. New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest significantly in engineering, research and development projects. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  If a 10person or company claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly, time consuming, and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues.  The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our on-going business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the orbdinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.  The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company.  Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Credit Risk. Certain automakers and Tier 1 customers from time to time may consider the sale of certain business segments or bankruptcy as a result of financial stress.  Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The current economic environment continues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact the timeliness of customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables. Our allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed automotive mirror and electronics customers.  We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances.  Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.Supply Chain Disruptions. Due to the just-in-time supply chains within our business and the automotive industry, a disruption in a supply chain caused by one or more of our suppliers and/or an unrelated Tier 1 supplier due to part shortages, natural disasters, coronavirus, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. could disrupt our shipments to one or more automakers or Tier 1 customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed at our manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services could be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these risks. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.IT Infrastructure.  A failure of our information technology (""IT"") infrastructure could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our businesses over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward.  These systems may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We, and certain of our third-party vendors, receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.   Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.Employees.  Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. Throughout our Company, our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill sets and experience and a skilled workforce could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in, and low unemployment generally has caused, increased turnover. In addition, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key 11employees, including managers, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Government Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, and the Company has disclosed its findings annually to the SEC on Form SD around May 30 each year. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, the Company cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.The European New Car Assessment Program (""Euro NCAP"") provides an incentive for automobiles sold in Europe to apply safety technologies that include driver assist features such as lane detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection as standard equipment. Euro NCAP compliant driver assist systems are also capable of including high beam assist as a function. The increased application of Euro NCAP on European vehicles has impacted and could continue to impact take rates for the Company's SmartBeam application on these vehicles. On December 8, 2015, NHTSA proposed changes to the Administration’s 5-Star Safety Ratings for new vehicles (also known as the New Car Assessment Program or NCAP) and initiated a comment period. The proposed changes will, for the first time, encompass assessment of crash-avoidance technologies, which includes lower beam headlamp performance, semi-automatic headlamp switching, and blind spot detection. NHTSA originally intended to implement the enhancements in NCAP in 2018 beginning with model year 2019 vehicles. The NCAP implementation has been delayed. Under these proposed changes, the Company believes that its SmartBeam® technology will qualify with the semi-automatic headlamp NCAP rating system, and that its SmartBeam® technology and exterior mirrors with blind spot alert lighting can be included in a system that qualifies with the lower beam headlamp performance and blind spot detection NCAP rating system, respectively. On October 16, 2019, NHTSA issued a press release comparing NCAP to other regions’ version of NCAP, identified new technologies that are not currently included in NCAP, and suggested Congress legislatively direct actions to improve NCAP.On October 12, 2018, NHTSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (""NPRM"") for amendments to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (""FMVSS"") No. 108: Lamps, reflective devices, and associated equipment, and initiated a comment period. The NPRM proposes amendments that would permit the certification of adaptive driving beam head-lighting systems, if the manufacturer chooses to equip vehicles with these systems. NHTSA proposes to establish appropriate performance requirements to ensure the safe introduction of adaptive driving beam head-lighting systems if equipped on newly manufactured vehicles. The Company believes that its dynamic SmartBeam® lighting control system (dynamic forward lighting or DFL), which has been sold in markets outside of North America for several years, will meet the requirements of the new FMVSS No. 108 standards, if amended. The Company's SmartBeam® application has and will continue to be affected by increased competition suppliers of multi-function driver assist camera products, which are able to achieve some of the same functionality as SmartBeam® but at a lower cost, due to other suppliers leveraging similar hardware costs, but offering products with multiple software features.As noted, on October 10, 2019, an ANPRM was published seeking public comment on permitting camera-based rear visibility systems, as an alternative to inside and outside rearview mirrors required under FMVSS No. 111, “Rear Visibility,” which currently requires that vehicles be equipped with rearview mirrors to provide drivers with a view of objects that are to their side or to their side and rear. This ANPRM builds on NHTSA's prior efforts to obtain supporting technical information, data, and analysis on CMS so that the agency can determine whether these systems can provide the same level of safety as the rearview mirrors currently required under FMVSS No. 111. The ANPRM states that one reason NHTSA is seeking additional information is because research conducted by NHTSA and others between 2006 and 2017 has consistently shown that prototype and preproduction camera-based rear visibility systems can exhibit safety-relevant performance issues.International Operations.  We currently conduct operations in various countries and jurisdictions, including purchasing raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world, which subjects us to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements as well as various economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Some of these 12countries are considered growth markets. International sales and operations, especially in growth markets, subject us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:•Exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions;• Unexpected changes in laws, regulations, trade or monetary or fiscal policy, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the U.S. and other foreign countries;• Tariffs (as discussed herein), quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers;•Natural disasters, political crises, and public health crises (such as the coronavirus in Wuhan, China), which have caused and will likely continue to cause downtime and closures at both supplier and customer facilities;•Brexit, and its impact; •Expropriation and nationalization;• Difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;• Reduced intellectual property protection;•Withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;•Investment restrictions or requirements;• Export and import restrictions;• Violence and civil unrest in local countries;• Compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of various other countries; and•Exposure related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include:•Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If commodity prices rise, and if we are unable to recover these cost increases from our customers, such increases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations;•Increasing interest rates impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments and/or recognized losses due to an Other-Than-Temporary Impairment adjustment on held-to-maturity securities;•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, trade war, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels;•Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations; and•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of the state of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low closing price of $19.55 to a high closing price of $29.74 during calendar year 2019. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock relating to the issues discussed above or due to any of the following:•Variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;•Changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;•Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims;•The size of the public float of our common stock;•Market conditions, including the industry in which we operate; and•General macroeconomic conditions.13"

Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market.  Forward-looking statements include content supplied by IHS Markit Light Vehicle Production Forecast (January 17, 2019) (http://www.gentex.com/ forecast-disclaimer).The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry.  Customers within the auto industry comprise approximately 98% of our net sales. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment, while stable, continues to be uncertain and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile production levels, volatility with customer orders, supplier part and material shortages, automotive and Tier 1 supplier plant shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues/bankruptcies, commodity material cost increases and/or supply constraints, consumer vehicle preference shifts, where we may have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle, and supply chain stresses. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience plant shutdowns, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs which can result in delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts. This makes it challenging for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments.Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including three automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2018 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, and Daimler Group.The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Pricing Pressures. We continue to experience on-going pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable 8to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, increases in unit shipments of mirrors and electronics with advanced features, each of which pose an ongoing challenge, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Tariffs.  The geopolitical environment between the Unites States and other countries, including China and the European Union, continues to cause uncertainty on tariffs. Currently, it is expected that the Unites States will increase tariffs on March 1, 2019 with respect to certain good and materials imported from China, and it is further expected, that China will also increase certain tariffs on goods and materials imported from the United States, unless the two countries enter into a new trade agreement. The continuance of these tariffs and/or escalation of disputes in the geopolitical environment could interfere with automotive supply chains and could have a continued negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat.Additionally, other companies have demonstrated products that are competitive to our Full Display Mirror® system, and we acknowledge that dimming device (e.g., electrochromic) technology is the subject of research and development efforts by numerous third parties. On March 31, 2014, the NHTSA issued a final rule requiring rearview video systems in U.S. light vehicles by May 1, 2018, with a phase-in schedule requirement of 10% of vehicles after May 2016, 40% of vehicles after May 2017, and 100% of vehicles after May 2018.  The Company’s RCD mirror application meets all the technical requirements of the NHTSA rule when installed in a vehicle and appropriately paired with an OEM specified camera. The NHTSA rule that rearview video systems are required has increased competition for systems capable of rear video in a variety of locations in the vehicle.  Our RCD mirror application has and will continue to be affected by this increased competition.Our SmartBeam® product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products has already and could continue to impact the success of SmartBeam®. On March 31, 2014 the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow automakers to use CMS as an option to replace conventional rearview mirrors within North America, however, no final rule or legislation was made in response to this petition.  At the annual SAE Government-Industry Meeting in January 2017, NHTSA requested that SAE develop Recommended Procedures for test protocols and performance criteria for CMS that would replace mirror systems on light vehicles in the U.S. market. SAE assigned the task to the Driver Vision Committee, and the SAE Driver Vision Committee created a CMS Task Force to draft the Recommended Procedures. In the second half of 2018, the Office of Management and Budget published its regulatory and de-regulatory agenda, which included a reference to a pre-rule stage for NHTSA related to amending the existing rear visibility standard to allow the option for camera-monitor systems to replace mirrors. Also, NHTSA published a report dated October 2018 related to camera monitoring systems for outside mirror replacements.In July 2016, a revision to UN-ECE Regulation 46 was published with an effective date of June 18, 2016, which allows for camera monitor systems to replace mirrors within Japan and European countries. As of January 2017, camera monitoring systems are also permitted as an alternative to replace mirrors in the Korean market.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company continues to believe rearview mirrors provide a robust, simple and cost effective means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and remain the primary safety function for rear vision today.  Cameras when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism have some inherent limitations such as: electrical failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angle of the camera.  Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imagers and video displays as well.  The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors may well provide a more robust product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver.  The Company has launched a rear vision camera system that streams rear video to a rearview-mirror-integrated display using the Company's Full Display Mirror®.  This CMS solution uses three cameras to provide a comprehensive view of the sides and rear of the vehicle.  The Company also continues to develop in the areas of imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens design, image processing from the camera to the display, and camera lens cleaning.  The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving, there could be increased competition.9Product Mix.  We sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell during a given period. The automotive industry is subject to rapid technological change, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and cyclical, ever-changing consumer demand patterns. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products.  As a result of such changes and circumstances impacting our customers, sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth, in OEM sales demand, as well as in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration.  A decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Our forward guidance and estimates assume a certain geographic sales mix as well as a product sales mix. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Business Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets,have resources available for or obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses. Additionally, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, achieving projected synergies, and/or maximizing the value of acquired technologies and businesses. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate already exists and may increase, thereby potentially increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors, variable dimmable windows,certain electronics, and fire protection products, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  Lack of intellectual property protection in a number of countries, including China, poses risk for the Company. This trend represents an increasing risk to technology companies in the United States, including the Company.New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significant portion of our annual sales in engineering, research and development projects. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. If someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our on-going business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.  The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company.   Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Credit Risk. Certain automakers and Tier 1 customers from time to time may consider the sale of certain business segments or bankruptcy as a result of financial stress. Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The current economic environment continues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact the timeliness of customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables. Our allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed automotive mirror and electronics customers. We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.Supply Chain Disruptions. Due to the just-in-time supply chains within our business and the automotive industry, a disruption in a supply chain caused by one or more of our suppliers and/or an unrelated Tier 1 supplier due to part shortages, natural disasters, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. could disrupt our shipments to one or more 10automakers or Tier 1 customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed at our manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services could be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these potential costs. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.IT Infrastructure.  A failure of our information technology (""IT"") infrastructure could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our businesses over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward.  These systems may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We, and certain of our third-party vendors, receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.Employees.  Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.  Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in increased turnover.   In addition, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Government Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products.  These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, and the Company has disclosed its findings annually to the SEC on Form SD around May 30 each year.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, the Company cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.The European New Car Assessment Program (""Euro NCAP"") provides an incentive for automobiles sold in Europe to apply safety technologies that include driver assist features such as lane detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection as standard equipment.  Euro NCAP compliant driver assist systems are also capable of including high beam assist as a function.

We currently conduct operations in various countries and jurisdictions, including purchasing raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world, which subjects us to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements as well as various economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Some of these countries are considered growth markets. International sales and operations, especially in growth markets, subject us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:•Exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions;• Unexpected changes in laws, regulations, trade or monetary or fiscal policy, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the U.S. and other foreign countries;• Tariffs(as discussed above), quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers;•Brexit, and particularly, an uncontrolled Brexit •Expropriation and nationalization;• Difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;• Reduced intellectual property protection;•Withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;•Investment restrictions or requirements;• Export and import restrictions;• Violence and civil unrest in local countries;• Compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of various other countries; and•Exposure related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include:•Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If commodity prices rise, and if we are unable to recover these cost increases from our customers, such increases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations;•Increasing interest rates impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of fixed income investments and/or recognized losses due to an Other-Than-Temporary Impairment adjustment on held-to-maturity securities;•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, trade war, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels;•Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations; and12•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of the state of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low of $17.80 to a high of $25.41 during 2018. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate.

.Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  The statements contained in this communication that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements give the Company’s current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “goal”, “hope”, “may”, “plan”, “project”, “will”, and variations of such words and similar expressions.  Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company’s control, and could cause the Company’s results to differ materially from those described.  These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation: changes in general industry or regional market conditions; changes in consumer and customer preferences for our products (such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving); our ability to be awarded new business; continued uncertainty in pricing negotiations with customers; loss of business from increased competition; changes in strategic relationships; customer bankruptcies or divestiture of customer brands; fluctuation in vehicle production schedules; changes in product mix; raw material shortages; higher raw material, fuel, energy and other costs; unfavorable fluctuations in currencies or interest rates in the regions in which we operate; costs or difficulties related to the integration and/or ability to maximize the value of any new or acquired technologies and businesses; changes in regulatory conditions; warranty and recall claims and other litigation and customer reactions thereto; possible adverse results of pending or future litigation or infringement claims; changes in tax laws; import and export duty and tariff rates in or with the countries with which we conduct business; negative impact of any governmental investigations and associated litigations including securities litigations relating to the conduct of our business.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. 98% of our net sales are to customers within the automotive industry. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment, while stable, continues to provide some uncertainty and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile production levels, volatility with customer orders, supplier part and material shortages, automotive and tier one supplier plant shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues/bankruptcies, commodity material cost increases, consumer vehicle preference shifts, where we may have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle, and supply chain stresses. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience plant shutdowns, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs which can result in delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts. This makes it difficult for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments.Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including four automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2017 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, Daimler Group, and Ford Motor Company. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Pricing Pressures. We continue to experience on-going pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, increases in unit shipments of mirrors and electronics with advanced features, each of which pose an ongoing challenge, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.7Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat.Additionally, other companies have demonstrated products that are competitive to our Full Display Mirror® system, and we acknowledge that dimming device (e.g., electrochromic) technology is the subject of research and development efforts by third parties. On March 31, 2014, the NHTSA issued a final rule requiring rearview video systems in U.S. light vehicles by May 1, 2018, with a phase-in schedule requirement of 10% of vehicles after May 2016, 40% of vehicles after May 2017, and 100% of vehicles after May 2018.  In this release, NHTSA estimated that 57% of model year 2014 vehicles already have a rear video system, and that even without a final rule, 73% of the vehicles sold into North America would have already included a rearview video system by 2018. The Company’s RCD mirror application meets all the technical requirements of the NHTSA rule when installed in a vehicle and appropriately paired with an OEM specified camera. The NHTSA rule that rearview video systems are required has increased competition for systems capable of rear video in a variety of locations in the vehicle.  Our RCD mirror application has and will continue to be affected by this increased competition.Our SmartBeam® product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products could impact the success of SmartBeam®. On March 31, 2014 the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow automakers to use CMS as an option to replace conventional rearview mirrors within North America, however, no final rule or legislation was made in response to this petition.  At the annual SAE Government-Industry Meeting in January 2017, NHTSA requested that SAE develop Recommended Procedures for test protocols and performance criteria for CMS that would replace mirror systems on light vehicles in the U.S. market. SAE assigned the task to the Driver Vision Committee, and the SAE Driver Vision Committee created a CMS Task Force to draft the Recommended Procedures. In the second half of 2017, NHTSA published its Fiscal Year 2018 Budget Estimate that references rear visibility as an area for deregulation consideration. With that said, the Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, published by the Trump Administration after the NHTSA Fiscal Year 2018 Budget Estimate, does not reference rule making for new or changed requirements of the rear visibility standard. In July 2016, a revision to UN-ECE Regulation 46 was published with an effective date of June 18, 2016, which allows for camera monitor systems to replace mirrors within Japan and European countries. As of January 2017, camera monitoring systems are also permitted as an alternative to replace mirrors in the Korean market.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company continues to believe rearview mirrors provide a robust, simple and cost effective means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and remain the primary safety function for rear vision today.  Cameras when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism have some inherent limitations such as: electrical failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angle of the camera.  Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imagers and video displays as well.  The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors may well provide a more robust product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver.  The Company has launched a rear vision camera system that streams rear video to a rearview-mirror-integrated display using the Company's Full Display Mirror®.  This CMS solution uses three cameras to provide a comprehensive view of the sides and rear of the vehicle.  The Company also continues to develop in the areas of imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens design, image processing from the camera to the display, and camera lens cleaning.  The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving, there could be increased competition.Product Mix.  We sell products that have varying profit margins. Our financial performance can be impacted depending on the mix of products we sell during a given period. The automotive industry is subject to rapid technological change, vigorous competition, short product life cycles and cyclical, ever-changing consumer demand patterns. When our customers are adversely affected by these factors, we may be similarly affected to the extent that our customers reduce the volume of orders for our products.  As a result of such changes and circumstances impacting our customers, sales mix can shift which may have either favorable or unfavorable impact on revenue and would include shifts in regional growth, in OEM sales demand, as well as in consumer demand related to vehicle segment purchases and content penetration.  A decrease in consumer demand for specific types of vehicles where we have traditionally provided significant content could have a significant effect on our business, financial 8condition, and/or results of operations. Our forward guidance and estimates assume a certain geographic sales mix as well as a product sales mix. If actual results vary from this projected geographic and product mix of sales, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be negatively impacted.  Business Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses. Additionally, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, achieving projected synergies, and/or maximizing the value of acquired technologies and businesses. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate already exists and may increase, thereby potentially increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors, variable dimmable windows, electronics, and fire protection products, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  Lack of intellectual property protection in a number of countries, including China, poses risk for the Company. This trend represents an increasing risk to technology companies in the United States, including the Company.New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significant portion of our annual sales in engineering, research and development projects. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect our profitability and future growth. If someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our on-going business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.  The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company.   Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Credit Risk. Certain automakers and Tier 1 customers may be considering the sale of certain business segments or bankruptcy. Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The current economic environment continues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact the timeliness of customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables. Our overall allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed automotive mirror and electronics customers. We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.Supply Chain Disruptions. Due to the just-in-time supply chains within our business and the automotive industry, a disruption in a supply chain caused by one or more of our suppliers and/or an unrelated Tier 1 supplier due to part shortages, natural disasters, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. could disrupt our shipments to one or more automakers or Tier 1 customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed at our manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services could be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these potential costs. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.9IT Infrastructure.  A failure of our information technology (""IT"") infrastructure could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our businesses over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward.  These systems may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We, and certain of our third-party vendors, receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.Employees.  Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.  Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in increased turnover.   In addition, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Government Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products.  These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, and the Company has disclosed its findings annually to the SEC on Form SD around May 30 each year.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, the Company cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.The European New Car Assessment Program (""Euro NCAP"") provides an incentive for automobiles sold in Europe to apply safety technologies that include driver assist features such as lane detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection as standard equipment.  Euro NCAP compliant driver assist systems are also capable of including high beam assist as a function. The increased application of Euro NCAP on European vehicles could potentially replace the Company's SmartBeam application on these vehicles. On December 8, 2015, the NHTSA proposed changes to the Administration’s 5-Star Safety Ratings for new vehicles (also known as the New Car Assessment Program or NCAP) and initiated a comment period.  The proposed changes will, for the first time, encompass assessment of crash-avoidance technologies, which includes lower beam headlamp performance, semi-automatic headlamp switching, and blind spot detection.  NHTSA originally intended to implement the enhancements in NCAP in 2018 beginning with model year 2019 vehicles.  In January 2017, NHTSA, published a notice on SafeCar.gov stating the new goal for implementation was calendar year 2019 for model year 2020; however, the notice has been removed from the aforementioned website after the January 20, 2017 Regulatory Freeze Pending Review Memorandum from the Trump Administration. In addition, the aforementioned NHTSA Fiscal Year 2018 Budget Estimate allocated a portion of the budget for NCAP, including the possibility of a new comment period and that NHTSA will consider modernizing portions of the lighting standard to permit innovation in the area of adaptive driving-beam headlights.  10The Company believes that its SmartBeam® technology will qualify with the semi-automatic headlamp NCAP rating system, and that its SmartBeam® technology and exterior mirrors with blind spot alert lighting can be included in a system that qualifies with the lower beam headlamp performance and blind spot detection NCAP rating system, respectively.Interest Rate Risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of interest expense on borrowings used to finance an acquisition and working capital requirements. The Company's total variable-rate debt was $78.0 million as of December 31, 2017.   As of December 31, 2017, the Company held one interest rate swap agreement denominated in U.S. dollars that effectively converts $150 million of its variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt that had an effective date of July 31, 2015, and lasts through the term of the Company's loan agreement related thereto which is September 27, 2018. The interest rate swap derivative instrument is held and used by the Company as a tool for managing interest rate risk. The counterparty to the swap instrument is a large financial institution that the Company believes is of high-quality creditworthiness. While the Company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non-performance by this counterparty, such losses are not anticipated. The fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded within other accrued liabilities in the amount of $0.2 million on December 31, 2017.   As of December 31, 2017, the weighted-average interest rate on the Company's variable-rate debt was approximately 2.57%.  Based on loan balances as of December 31, 2017, and the effective date of July 31, 2015 of the interest rate swap, a one percent increase in the Company's borrowing rate would increase net interest expense paid by the Company on its borrowings by less than $0.1 million on an annual basis. The Company does not enter into contracts for speculative or trading purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instruments.International Operations.  We currently conduct operations in various countries and jurisdictions, including purchasing raw materials and other supplies from many different countries around the world, which subjects us to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements as well as various economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Some of these countries are considered growth markets. International sales and operations, especially in growth markets, subject us to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad, including:•Exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions;• Unexpected changes in laws, regulations, trade or monetary or fiscal policy, including interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and changes in the rate of inflation in the U.S. and other foreign countries;• Tariffs, quotas, customs and other import or export restrictions and other trade barriers;•Expropriation and nationalization;• Difficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;• Reduced intellectual property protection;•Withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;•Investment restrictions or requirements;• Export and import restrictions;• Violence and civil unrest in local countries;• Compliance with the requirements of an increasing body of applicable anti-bribery laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws of various other countries; and•Exposure related to buying, selling and financing in currencies other than the local currencies of the countries in which we operate.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include:•Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If commodity prices rise, and if we are unable to recover these cost increases from our customers, such increases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations;•Uncertain equity markets may negatively impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of equity investments and/or recognized losses due to an Other-Than-Temporary Impairment adjustment on available-for-sale securities;•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels;•Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations; and11•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of the state of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low of $16.59 to a high of $22.12 during 2017. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock relating to the issues discussed above or due to any of the following:•Variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;•Changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;•Intellectual property litigation and infringement claims;•The size of the public float of our common stock;•Market conditions, including the industry in which we operate; and•General macroeconomic conditions.12"

.Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  The statements contained in this communication that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements give the Company’s current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “goal”, “hope”, “may”, “plan”, “project”, “will”, and variations of such words and similar expressions.  Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company’s control, and could cause the Company’s results to differ materially from those described.  These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, changes in general industry or regional market conditions; changes in consumer and customer preferences for our products (such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving); our ability to be awarded new business; continued uncertainty in pricing negotiations with customers; loss of business from increased competition; changes in strategic relationships; customer bankruptcies or divestiture of customer brands; fluctuation in vehicle production schedules; changes in product mix; raw material shortages; higher raw material, fuel, energy and other costs; unfavorable fluctuations in currencies or interest rates in the regions in which we operate; costs or difficulties related 7to the integration and/or ability to maximize the value of any new or acquired technologies and businesses; changes in regulatory conditions; warranty and recall claims and other litigation and customer reactions thereto; possible adverse results of pending or future litigation or infringement claims; changes in tax laws; import and export duty and tariff rates in or with the countries with which we conduct business; negative impact of any governmental investigations and associated litigations including securities litigations relating to the conduct of our business.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. 98% of our net sales are to customers within the automotive industry. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment, while stable, continues to provide some uncertainty (especially in the Japan and Korean markets) and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile production levels, volatility with customer orders, supplier part and material shortages, automotive and tier one supplier plant shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues/bankruptcies, commodity material cost increases, consumer vehicle preference shifts, where we may have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle, and supply chain stresses. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience plant shutdowns, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs which can result in delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts. This makes it difficult for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments.Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including three automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2016 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, and Ford Motor Company. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Pricing Pressures. We continue to experience on-going pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, increases in unit shipments of mirrors and electronics with advanced features, each of which pose an ongoing challenge, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor and wholly-owned subsidiary of Magna International, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat.On March 31, 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (""NHTSA"") issued a final rule requiring rearview video systems in U.S. light vehicles by May 1, 2018, with a phase-in schedule requirement of 10% of vehicles after May 2016, 40% of vehicles after May 2017, and 100% of vehicles after May 2018.  In this release, NHTSA estimated that 57% of model year 2014 vehicles already have a rear video system, and that even without a final rule, 73% of the vehicles sold into North America would have already included a rearview video system by 2018. This NHTSA ruling, as is indicated from the percentage of U.S. vehicles already having a rearview video solution, does not currently indicate opportunity for new RCD mirror applications for the Company.  Customer opportunities may exist by the time the 100% requirement is in place, but there is no certainty in this regard.  The Company’s RCD mirror application meets all the technical requirements of the NHTSA rule when installed in a vehicle and appropriately paired with an OEM specified camera. The NHTSA rule that rearview video systems are required has increased competition for systems capable of rear video in a variety of locations in the vehicle.  Our RCD mirror application has and will continue to be affected by this increased competition.Our SmartBeam® product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's 8high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products could impact the long-term success of SmartBeam®.  As we continue to expand the capabilities of our CMOS imager technology, we recognize that we are competing against multiple-function driver-assist technologies that have presented and will continue to present a competitive threat for SmartBeam®.  Our CMOS imager technology when used as a rearward facing automotive video camera is a video camera that competes with other commercially available automotive video cameras.  While we believe our video camera, when combined with our display mirror products, produces a higher dynamic range than other commercially available automotive video cameras, we recognize other technologies are highly competitive and these features are price sensitive.  Our ability to market and sell our products may be affected by the high level of competition in this market.  On March 31, 2014 the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow automakers to use cameras as an option to replace conventional rearview mirrors within North America, however, no comment, final rule, or legislation was made in response to this petition.  In July 2016, a revision to UN-ECE Regulation 46 was published with an effective date of June 18, 2016, which allows for camera monitor systems to replace mirrors within Japan and European countries. As of January 2017, Camera monitoring systems are also permitted as an alternative to replace mirrors in the Korean market.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company continues to believe rearview mirrors provide a robust, simple and cost effective means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and remain the primary safety function for rear vision today.  Cameras when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism have some inherent limitations such as: electrical failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angle of the camera.  Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imagers and video displays as well.  The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors may well provide a more robust product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver.  The Company also continues to develop in the areas of imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens design, image processing from the camera to the display, and camera lens cleaning.  The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, such as cameras replacing mirrors and/or autonomous driving, there could be increased competition.Business Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses. Additionally, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, achieving projected synergies, and/or maximizing the value of acquired technologies and businesses. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate exists and may increase, thereby potentially increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors, variable dimmable windows, and electronics, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  Lack of intellectual property protection in a number of countries, including China, poses risk for the Company. This trend represents an increasing risk to technology companies in the United States, including the Company.New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significant portion of our annual sales in engineering, research and development projects as set forth in our Consolidated Statements of Income of our Consolidated Financial Statements filed with this report. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect our profitability and future growth. If someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our on-going business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.  The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company.   Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.9Credit Risk. In light of ongoing financial stresses within the certain regions within the worldwide automotive industry, certain automakers and Tier 1 customers may be considering the sale of certain business segments or bankruptcy. Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The current economic environment continues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact the timeliness of customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables. Our overall allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed automotive mirror and electronics customers. We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.Supply Chain Disruptions. Due to the just-in-time supply chains within our business and the automotive industry, a disruption in a supply chain caused by one or more of our suppliers and/or an unrelated Tier 1 supplier due to part shortages, natural disasters, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. could disrupt our shipments to one or more automakers or Tier 1 customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed at our manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services could be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these potential costs. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.IT Infrastructure.  A failure of our information technology (IT) infrastructure could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our businesses over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward.  These systems may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We, and certain of our third-party vendors, receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.Employees.  Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.  Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in increased turnover.   In addition, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Government Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products.  These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016, and the Company has disclosed its findings annually to the SEC on Form SD around May 30 10each year.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, the Company cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.The European New Car Assessment Program (""Euro NCAP"") provides an incentive for automobiles sold in Europe to apply safety technologies that include driver assist features such as lane detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection as standard equipment.  Euro NCAP compliant driver assist systems are also capable of including high beam assist as a function. The increased application of Euro NCAP on European vehicles could potentially replace the Company's SmartBeam application on these vehicles. On December 8, 2015 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (""NHTSA"") proposed changes to the Administration’s 5-Star Safety Ratings for new vehicles (also known as the New Car Assessment Program or NCAP) and initiated a comment period.  The proposed changes will, for the first time, encompass assessment of crash-avoidance technologies, which includes lower beam headlamp performance, semi-automatic headlamp switching, and blind spot detection.  NHTSA originally intended to implement the enhancements in NCAP in 2018 beginning with model year 2019 vehicles.  In January 2017, NHTSA, published a notice on SafeCar.gov stating the new goal for implementation was calendar year 2019 for model year 2020; however, the notice has been removed from the aforementioned website after the January 20, 2017 Regulatory Freeze Pending Review Memorandum from the Trump Administration. The Company believes that its SmartBeam® technology will qualify with the semi-automatic headlamp NCAP rating system, and that its SmartBeam® technology and exterior mirrors with blind spot alert lighting can be included in a system that qualifies with the lower beam headlamp performance and blind spot detection NCAP rating system, respectively.Our results of operations could also be impacted by changes in tax laws and rates, which could affect the measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate.Interest Rate Risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of interest expense on borrowings used to finance an acquisition and working capital requirements. The Company's total variable-rate debt was $185.6 million as of December 31, 2016.   As of December 31, 2016, the Company held one interest rate swap agreement denominated in U.S. dollars that effectively converts $150 million of its variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt that had an effective date of July 31, 2015 lasting through the term of the Company's loan agreement related thereto which is September 27, 2018. The interest rate swap derivative instrument is held and used by the Company as a tool for managing interest rate risk. The counterparty to the swap instrument is a large financial institution that the Company believes is of high-quality creditworthiness. While the Company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non-performance by this counterparty, such losses are not anticipated. The fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded within other accrued liabilities in the amount of $1.8 million on December 31, 2016.   As of December 31, 2016, the weighted-average interest rate on the Company's variable-rate debt was approximately 1.77%.  Based on loan balances as of December 31, 2016 and the effective date of July 31, 2015 of the interest rate swap, a one percent increase in the Company's borrowing rate would increase net interest expense paid by the Company on its borrowings by approximately $.3 million on an annual basis. The Company does not enter into contracts for speculative or trading purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instruments.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include:•Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If commodity prices rise, and if we are not able to recover these cost increases from our customers, such increases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.•Uncertain equity markets may negatively impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of equity investments and/or recognized losses due to an Other-Than-Temporary Impairment adjustment on available-for-sale securities.•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall general economic conditions. Any continued adverse 11worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels.•Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of the state of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low of $12.93 to a high of $20.39 during 2016. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock relating to the issues discussed above or due to any of the following:•variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;•changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;•intellectual property litigation and infringement claims;•the size of the public float of our common stock;•market conditions, including the industry in which we operate; and•general macroeconomic conditions.12"

The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. 98% of our net sales are to customers within the automotive industry. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment, while improving, continues to be uncertain (especially in Europe and the Japan and Korean markets, which collectively are larger for us than North America as shipping destinations) and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile production levels, volatility with customer orders, supplier part shortages, automotive 7plant shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues/bankruptcies, commodity material cost increases, consumer preference shift to smaller vehicles, where we have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle, and supply chain stresses. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience bankruptcies, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs which result in delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts.  This challenge makes it difficult for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments.Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including three automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2015 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, and Ford Motor Company. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Pricing Pressures. We continue to experience on-going pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, increases in unit shipments of mirrors and electronics with advanced features, each of which pose an ongoing challenge, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor and wholly-owned subsidiary of Magna International, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat.On March 31, 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a final rule requiring rearview video systems in U.S. light vehicles by May 1, 2018, with a phase-in schedule requirement of 10% of vehicles after May 2016, 40% of vehicles after May 2017, and 100% of vehicles after May 2018.  In this release, NHTSA estimated that 57% of model year 2014 vehicles already have a rear video system, and that even without a final rule, 73% of the vehicles sold into North America would have already included a rearview video system by 2018. This NHTSA ruling, as is indicated from the percentage of U.S. vehicles already having a rearview video solution, does not currently indicate an immediate opportunity for new Rear Camera Display (RCD) mirror applications for the Company.  Customer opportunities may exist by the time the 100% requirement is in place, but there is no certainty in this regard.  The Company’s rear camera display mirror application meets all the technical requirements of the NHTSA ruling when installed in a vehicle and appropriately paired with an OEM specified camera. The NHTSA ruling that rearview video systems are required has increased competition for systems capable of rear video in a variety of locations in the vehicle.  Our Rear Camera Display (RCD) mirror application has and will continue to be affected by this increased competition.Our SmartBeam® product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products could impact the long-term success of SmartBeam®.  As we continue to expand the capabilities of our CMOS imager technology for additional driver-assist features, we recognize that we are competing against multiple-function driver-assist technologies that have presented and will continue to present a competitive threat for SmartBeam®.  Our CMOS imager technology when used as a rearward facing automotive video camera is a video camera that competes with other commercially available automotive video cameras.  While we believe our video camera, when combined with our display mirror products, produces a higher dynamic range than other commercially available automotive video cameras, we recognize other technologies are highly competitive and these features are price sensitive.  Our ability to market and sell our products may be affected by the high level of competition in this market.  On March 31, 2014 the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow automakers to use cameras as an option to replace conventional rearview mirrors within North America, however, no final ruling or legislation was made in response to this petition.  In November 2015, a revision to UN-ECE Regulation 46 was approved, which would allow camera monitor systems to replace mirrors within European countries.  The revision will enter into force in mid-to-late 2016.  Rearview mirrors provide a robust, simple and cost effective means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and are the primary safety function for rear vision today.  Cameras when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism have some inherent limitations such as: electrical 8failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angle of the camera.  Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imager cameras and video displays as well.  The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors may well provide a safer overall product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver.  The Company also continues to develop in the areas of camera imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens design, image processing from the camera to the display, and camera lens cleaning.  The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, there could be increased competition.Business Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses. Additionally, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate exists and may increase, thereby potentially increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors, variable dimmable windows, and electronics, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  Lack of intellectual property protection in a number of countries, including China, poses risk for the Company. This trend represents an increasing risk to technology companies in the United States, including the Company.New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significant portion of our annual sales in engineering, research and development projects as set forth in our Consolidated Statements of Income of our Consolidated Financial Statements filed with this report. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect our profitability and future growth. If someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our on-going business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.  The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company.   Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Credit Risk. In light of the continuing financial stresses within the certain regions within the worldwide automotive industry, certain automakers and Tier 1 customers may be considering the sale of certain business segments or bankruptcy. Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The current economic environment continues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact the timeliness of customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables. Our overall allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed automotive mirror and electronics customers. We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.Supply Chain Disruptions. Due to the just-in-time supply chains within the automotive industry, a disruption in a supply chain caused by one or more of our suppliers and/or an unrelated Tier 1 supplier due to part shortages, natural disasters, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. could disrupt our shipments to one or more automakers or Tier 1 customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed at our manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should a 9catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services could be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these potential costs. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.IT Infrastructure.  A failure of our information technology (IT) infrastructure could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our businesses over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward.  These systems may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.Employees.  Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.  Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill sets and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in increased turnover.   In addition, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Government Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products.  These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013,  2014, and 2015, and the Company has disclosed its findings annually to the SEC on Form SD around May 30 each year.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, the Company cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.The European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) provides an incentive for automobiles sold in Europe to apply safety technologies that include driver assist features such as lane detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection as standard equipment.  Euro NCAP compliant driver assist systems are also capable of including high beam assist as a function. The increased application of Euro NCAP on European vehicles could potentially replace the Company's SmartBeam application on these vehicles. On December 8, 2015 the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) proposed changes to the Administration’s 5-Star Safety Ratings for new vehicles (also known as the New Car Assessment Program or NCAP) and initiated a comment period.  The proposed changes will, for the first time, encompass assessment of crash-avoidance technologies, which includes lower beam headlamp performance, semi-automatic headlamp switching, and blind spot detection.  At this time, NHTSA intends to implement the enhancements in NCAP in 2018 beginning with model year 2019 vehicles.  The Company believes that its SmartBeam® technology will be qualify with the semi-automatic headlamp NCAP rating system, and that its SmartBeam® technology and exterior mirrors with blind spot alert lighting can be included in a system that qualifies with the lower beam headlamp performance and blind spot detection NCAP rating system, respectively.10Interest Rate Risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of interest expense on borrowings used to finance an acquisition and working capital requirements. The Company's total variable-rate debt was $233.1 million as of December 31, 2015.   As of December 31, 2015, the Company held one interest rate swap agreement denominated in U.S. dollars that effectively converts $150 million of its variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt that had an effective date of July 31, 2015 lasting through the term of the Company's loan agreement related thereto which is September 27, 2018. The interest rate swap derivative instrument is held and used by the Company as a tool for managing interest rate risk. The counterparty to the swap instrument is a large financial institution that the Company believes is of high-quality creditworthiness. While the Company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non-performance by this counterparty, such losses are not anticipated. The fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded within other accrued liabilities in the amount of $2.9 million at December 31, 2015.   As of December 31, 2015, the weighted-average interest rate on the Company's variable-rate debt was approximately 1.43%.  Based on loan balances as of December 31, 2015 and the effective date of July 31, 2015 of the interest rate swap, a one percent increase in the Company's borrowing rate would increase net interest expense paid by the Company on its borrowings by approximately $.8 million dollars on an annual basis. The Company does not enter into contracts for speculative or trading purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instruments.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include:•Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If commodity prices rise, and if we are not able to recover these cost increases from our customers, such increases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.•Uncertain equity markets may negatively impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of equity investments and/or recognized losses due to an Other-Than-Temporary Impairment adjustment on available-for-sale securities.•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels.•Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of the state of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low of $13.84 to a high of $18.80 during 2015. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock relating to the issues discussed above or due to any of the following:•variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;•changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;•intellectual property litigation and infringement claims;•the size of the public float of our common stock;•market conditions, including the industry in which we operate; and•general macroeconomic conditions.11"

.Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  The statements contained in this communication that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements give the Company’s current expectations or forecasts of future events. These forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of words such as “anticipate”, “believe”, “could”, “estimate”, “expect”, “forecast”, “goal”, “hope”, “may”, “plan”, “project”, “will”, and variations of such words and similar expressions.  Such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company’s control, and could cause the Company’s results to differ materially from those described.  These risks and uncertainties include, without limitation, changes in general industry or regional market conditions; changes in consumer and customer preferences for our products; our ability to be awarded new business; continued uncertainty in pricing negotiations with customers; loss of business from increased competition; customer bankruptcies or divestiture of customer brands; fluctuation in vehicle production schedules; changes in product mix; raw material shortages; higher raw material, fuel, energy and other costs; unfavorable fluctuations in currencies or interest rates in the regions in which we operate; costs or difficulties related to the integration of any new or acquired technologies and businesses; changes in regulatory conditions; warranty and recall claims and other litigation and customer reactions thereto; possible adverse results of pending or future litigation or infringement claims; negative impact of any governmental investigations and associated litigations including securities litigations relating to the conduct of our business; integration of the newly acquired HomeLink business operations; retention of the newly acquired customers of the HomeLink business; and expansion of product offerings including those incorporating HomeLink technology.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law or the rules of the NASDAQ Global Select Market. The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. 97% of our net sales are to customers within the automotive industry. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment, while improving, continues to be uncertain (especially in Europe and the Japan and Korean markets, which collectively are larger for us than North America as shipping destinations) and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile production levels, volatility with customer orders, supplier part shortages, automotive plant shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues/bankruptcies, commodity material cost increases, consumer preference shift to smaller vehicles, where we have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle, and supply chain stresses. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience bankruptcies, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs which result in delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts.  This challenge makes it difficult for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments.Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including four automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2014 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen Group, Toyota Motor Company, FCA (Fiat Chrysler Automobiles) Group and Daimler AG. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Pricing Pressures. We continue to experience on-going pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, and increases in unit sales volume, each of which pose an ongoing challenge, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Competition.  We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor and wholly-owned subsidiary of Magna International, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat.8On March 31, 2014, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a final rule requiring rearview video systems in U.S. light vehicles by May 1, 2018, with a phase-in schedule requirement of 10% of vehicles after May 2016, 40% of vehicles after May 2017, and 100% of vehicles after May 2018.  In this release, NHTSA estimated that 57% of model year 2014 vehicles already have a rear video system, and that even without a final rule, 73% of the vehicles sold into North America would have already included a rearview video system by 2018. This NHTSA ruling, as is indicated from the percentage of U.S. vehicles already having a rearview video solution, does not currently indicate an immediate opportunity for new  Rear Camera Display (RCD) mirror applications for the Company.  Customer opportunities may exist by the time the 100% requirement is in place, but there is no certainty in this regard.  The Company’s rear camera display mirror application meets all the technical requirements of the NHTSA ruling when installed in a vehicle and appropriately paired with an OEM specified camera. The NHTSA ruling that rearview video systems are required has increased competition for systems capable of rear video in a variety of locations in the vehicle.  Our Rear Camera Display (RCD) mirror application has and will continue to be affected by this increased competition.Our SmartBeam® product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products could impact the long-term success of  SmartBeam®.  As we continue to expand the capabilities of our CMOS imager technology for additional driver-assist features, we recognize that we are competing against multiple-function driver-assist technologies that have presented and will continue to present a competitive threat for SmartBeam®.  Our CMOS imager technology when used as a rearward facing automotive video camera is a video camera that that competes with other commercially available automotive video cameras.  While we believe our video camera,  when combined with our display mirror products produces a higher dynamic range than other commercially available automotive video cameras, we recognize other technologies are highly competitive and these features are price sensitive.  Our ability to market and sell our products may be affected by the high level of competition in this market.  On March 31, 2014 the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to allow automakers to use cameras as an option to replace conventional rearview mirrors. Rearview mirrors  provide a robust and simple means to view the surrounding areas of a vehicle and are the primary safety function for rear vision today.  Cameras when used as the primary rear vision delivery mechanism have some inherent limitations. Examples of these limitations include: electrical failure; cameras being blocked or obstructed; depth perception challenges; and viewing angle of the camera.  Nonetheless, the Company continues designing and manufacturing not only rearview mirrors, but CMOS imager cameras and video displays as well.  The Company believes that combining video displays with mirrors may well provide a safer overall product by addressing all driving conditions in a single solution that can be controlled by the driver.  The Company also continues  to develop in the areas of camera imager performance, camera dynamic range, lens optics design, image processing from the camera to the display and camera lens cleaning.  The Company acknowledges that as such technology evolves over time, there could be increased competition.Business Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition targets, obtain financing for acquisitions on satisfactory terms, successfully acquire identified targets or manage timing of acquisitions with capital obligations across our businesses. Additionally, we may not be successful in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations and achieving projected synergies. Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate exists and may increase, thereby potentially increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our growth, profitability and results of operations.Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors and electronics, although no single patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  Lack of intellectual property protection in a number of countries, including China possess risk for the Company. This trend represents an increasing risk to technology companies in the United States, including the Company.9New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significant portion of our annual sales in engineering, research and development projects as set forth in our Consolidated Statements of Income of our Consolidated Financial Statements filed with this report. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect our profitability and future growth. If someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our on-going business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.  The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company.   Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Credit Risk. In light of the continuing financial stresses within the certain regions within the worldwide automotive industry, certain automakers and Tier 1 customers are considering the sale of certain business segments or may be considering bankruptcy. Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The current economic environment continues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact timely customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables. Our overall allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed automotive mirror and electronics customers. We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances. Refer to Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.Supply Chain Disruptions. Due to the just-in-time supply chains within the automotive industry, a disruption in a supply chain caused by one or more of our suppliers and/or an unrelated tier one supplier due to part shortages, natural disasters, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. could disrupt our shipments to one or more automakers or Tier 1 customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed at our manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services could be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these potential costs. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.IT Infrastructure.  A failure of our information technology (IT) infrastructure could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology infrastructure and our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. For example, we have implemented enterprise resource planning and other IT systems in certain aspects of our businesses over a period of several years and continue to update and further implement new systems going forward.  These systems may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.  We and certain of our third-party vendors receive and store personal information in connection with our human resources operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like all IT systems, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with our customers, lead to claims against the Company and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.10Employees.  Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.  Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in increased turnover.   In addition, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Government Regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products.  These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013 and 2014, and the Company disclosed its findings to the SEC on Form SD on May 30, 2014.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, the Company cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Also, the Company may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if the Company is unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in the Company's products through the procedures the Company may implement.The European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) provides an incentive for automobiles sold in Europe to apply safety technologies that include driver assist features such as lane detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection as standard equipment.  Euro NCAP compliant driver assist systems are also capable of including high beam assist as a function.  The increased application of Euro NCAP on European vehicles could potentially replace the Company's SmartBeam application on these vehicles. Interest Rate Risk. The Company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of interest expense on borrowings used to finance an acquisition and working capital requirements. The Company's total variable-rate debt was $265.6 million as of December 31, 2014.   As of December 31, 2014, the Company held one interest rate swap agreement denominated in U.S. dollars that effectively converts $150 million of its variable-rate debt to fixed-rate debt  with an effective date  of July 31, 2015 and lasting through the term of the Company's loan agreement related thereto which is September 27, 2018. The interest rate swap derivative instrument is held and used by the Company as a tool for managing interest rate risk. The counterparty to the swap instrument is a large financial institution that the Company believes is of high-quality creditworthiness. While the Company may be exposed to potential losses due to the credit risk of non-performance by this counterparty, such losses are not anticipated. The fair value of the interest rate swap was recorded within other accrued liabilities in the amount of $1.5 million at December 31, 2014.   As of December 31, 2014, the weighted-average interest rate on the Company's variable-rate debt was approximately 1.17%.  Based on loan balances as of December 31, 2014 and the effective date of July 31, 2015 of the interest rate swap, a one percent increase in the Company's borrowing rate would increase net interest expense paid by the Company on its borrowings by approximately $2.5 million dollars on an annual basis. The Company does not enter into contracts for speculative or trading purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instruments.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include:•Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If commodity prices rise, and if we are not able to recover these cost increases from our customers, such increases could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.•Uncertain equity markets may negatively impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of equity investments and/or recognized losses due to an Other-Than-Temporary Impairment adjustment on available-for-sale securities.•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall, general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels.11•Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims may adversely affect  our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of the state of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low of $13.17 to a high of $19.06 during 2014 as adjusted for a stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend issued on December 31, 2014. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock relating to the issues discussed above or due to any of the following:•variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;•changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;•intellectual property litigation and infringement claims;•the size of the public float of our common stock;•market conditions, including the industry in which we operate; and•general macroeconomic conditions"

The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. 98% of our net sales are to customers within the automotive industry. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment, while improving, continues to be uncertain (especially in Europe, which is our largest automotive shipping destination) and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile production levels, volatility with customer orders, supplier part shortages, automotive plan shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues/bankruptcies, commodity material cost increases, consumer preference shift to smaller vehicles, where we have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle, due to fuel costs and environmental concerns, and supply chain stresses. If automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience bankruptcies, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Automakers continue to experience volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs which result in delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package configurations, and inaccurate volume forecasts.  This challenge makes it difficult for us to forecast future sales and manage costs, inventory, capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments.Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including three automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales in 2013 (including direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Volkswagen/Audi, Toyota Motor Company and Daimler AG. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Pricing Pressures. We continue to experience on-going pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our profit margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, and increases in unit sales volume, each of which pose an ongoing challenge, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Competition.   We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor and wholly-owned subsidiary of Magna International, may have considerably more resources available to it, and may present a formidable competitive threat.8The Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007 (KTSA), indicating rules would be instituted requiring that new vehicles be equipped with a rear video camera and a rear video display, had implementation of such rules delayed multiple times.  The KTSA indication that rear video would be required has increased competition for systems capable of rear video in a variety of locations in the vehicle.  Our Rear Camera Display mirror application has and will continue to be affected by this increased competition.Our SmartBeam® product is a driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with other multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicle's high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products could impact the long-term success of the SmartBeam®.  As we continue to expand the capabilities of its CMOS imager technology for additional driver-assist features, we recognize that we are competing against multiple-function driver-assist technologies that have presented and will continue to present a competitive threat for SmartBeam®.  Business Combinations. We anticipate that acquisitions of businesses and assets may play a role in our future growth.

Competition for acquisition opportunities in the various industries in which we operate may rise, thereby increasing our costs of making acquisitions or causing us to refrain from making further acquisitions. We are also subject to applicable antitrust laws and must avoid anticompetitive behavior. These and other acquisition-related factors may negatively and adversely impact our growth, profitability and results of operations.  The integration of the HomeLink® business will continue to occur over the next 12 to 18 months. Many factors, though not currently expected, could introduce additional risks to the business including customer approvals and support that, if not received, could have a negative impact on the Company and future performance. Examples of risk associated with customer support and approvals are in the areas of manufacturing changes, purchase order changes, freight and logistics changes, sourcing awards for new and replacement programs and quality approvals and sign-offs.  In addition, we will face risks in regard to our ability to own and operate all facets of the HomeLink® business, including support from suppliers and compatibility partners, manufacturing skills, equipment and know-how, capacity constraints, electronic ordering systems, inventory levels, shipping and logistics systems, and invoicing/payment systems. Moreover, there are inherent business risks associated with disruptive technologies, consumer preference changes, macro-economic impacts and customer business relationships that  may negatively and adversely impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors and electronics,  although no singular patent is necessarily required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The lack of intellectual property protection is well-known in a number of countries, including China. This trend represents an increasing risk to technology companies in the United States, including Gentex.New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significant portion of our annual sales in engineering, research and development projects as set forth in our Consolidated Statements of Income of our Consolidated Financial Statements filed with this report.

Our business success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel.  Our ability to sustain and grow our business requires us to hire, retain and develop a highly skilled and diverse management team and workforce. Failure to ensure that we have the leadership capacity with the necessary skill set and experience could impede our ability to deliver our growth objectives and execute our strategic plan. Organizational and reporting changes within management could result in increased turnover.   In addition, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees, including managers, could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Government Regulations.  New regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products.  These new requirements required due diligence efforts in 2013, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in May 2014.  There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, 10processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.The European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) provides an incentive to European automobile manufacturers to make safety technologies that include camera based driver assist features such as lane detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection as standard equipment.  Euro NCAP compliant camera based driver assist systems are also capable of including high beam assist as a function.  The increased application of Euro NCAP on European vehicles can potentially have a negative impact on our SmartBeam® product by utilizing driver assist camera systems that include the high beam assist feature.  While the Company does continue product development and launch of new SmartBeam® and new driver assist camera products on European vehicles, the potential for increased competition may exist in the future.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include: •Volatility in commodity prices may adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.  If commodity prices rise, and if we are not able to recover these cost increases from our customers, these increases will have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.•Uncertain equity markets could negatively impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of equity investments and/or recognized losses due to an Other-Than-Temporary impairment adjustment on available-for-sale securities.•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business, given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall, general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels.•Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims could adversely affect  our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.•Interest rate fluctuations on the Company's long term debt financing could negatively impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low of $18.11 to a high of $34.15 during 2013. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock relating to the issues discussed above or due to any of the following: •variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;•changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;•variations in our anticipated or actual operating results related to the HomeLink® acquisition in 2013;•changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of how the Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007 (which has been delayed several times), and in particular the new rulemaking, may impact our business in the future;11•intellectual property litigation and infringement claims;•the size of the public float of our common stock;•market conditions, including the industry in which we operate, and•general macroeconomic conditions"

.Safe Harbor for Forward-Looking Statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act, as amended, that are based on management’s beliefs, and information currently available to us, and are also based on assumptions and analysis made by us in light of our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances.  However, whether actual results and developments will conform to our current expectations, estimates and projections about the global automotive industry, the economy and the Company itself is subject to a number of risks, assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, and the affects can be difficult to predict. Words like “anticipates,” “believes,” “confident,” “estimates,” “expects,” “forecasts,” “hopes”, “likely,” “plans,” “projects,” “optimistic,” and “should,” and variations of such words and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. These statements do not guarantee future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict with regard to timing, expense, likelihood and degree of occurrence. These risks include, without limitation, the pace of economic activity in Europe, Asia and in the United States, employment and other general economic conditions; worldwide automotive production; the maintenance of the Company's market share; the ability to control costs, including the ability to achieve purchasing and manufacturing cost reductions, control and leverage fixed overhead costs, maintain margins; the ability to control E,R&D and S,G&A expenses. Additionally, these risks include competitive pricing pressures; the mix of products purchased by customers; the market for and the success of certain of the Company's mirror products (e.g. Rear Camera Display, SmartBeam ® and other camera-based driver-assist and lighting-assist products), including vehicle model penetration and option take rates; changes in customers' marketing strategies; consumer confidence and the impact on production volume levels; intellectual property litigation risk; the ability to continue to make and sell product innovations; customer inventory management; scheduled production shutdowns at our customers' production facilities; currency fluctuations; interest rates; equity prices; the financial strength/stability of the Company's customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers); potential impact of supply chain disruptions including but not limited to those caused by natural disasters and any other part shortages; potential restructuring/sale of OEM business segments or suppliers; potential customer (including their Tier 1 suppliers) bankruptcies; and other risks identified in the Company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what is expressed or forecasted. Furthermore, the Company undertakes no obligation to update, amend, or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.14The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. 98% of our net sales are to customers within the automotive industry. The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current economic environment continues to be uncertain (especially in Europe, which is our largest automotive shipping destination) and continues to cause increased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile production levels, volatility with customer orders, supplier part shortages, automotive plan shutdowns, customer and supplier financial issues/bankruptcies, commodity material cost increases, consumer preference shift to smaller vehicles, where we have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle, due to fuel costs and environmental concerns, and supply chain stresses. If additional automotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) and suppliers experience bankruptcies, work stoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Automakers continue to experience increased volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs which have, in some cases, resulted in delays or cancellations of new vehicle platforms, package reconfigurations and inaccurate volume forecasts. This volatility and uncertainty has made it more difficult for us to forecast future sales, effectively manage costs and utilize capital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments.Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including five automotive customers which each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales (includes direct sales to OEM customers and sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Toyota Motor Company, VW/Audi, Hyundai/Kia, Daimler AG and General Motors Corporation. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. Effective October 1, 2003, General Motors Corporation began including a 30-day escape clause into its contracts in the event its suppliers are not competitive on pricing. Effective January 1, 2004, Ford Motor Company began imposing new contract terms, including the right to terminate a supplier contract for any or no reason.Pricing Pressures. In addition to price reductions over the life of our long-term agreements, we continue to experience significant pricing pressures from our automotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our margins to the extent that we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions, productivity improvements, and increases in unit sales volume, each of which pose an ongoing challenge. In addition, financial pressures, increasing production volumes and overall increasing book of business at certain automakers are resulting in increased cost reduction efforts by them, including requests for additional price reductions, decontenting certain features from vehicles, customer market testing of future business, dual sourcing initiatives and warranty cost-sharing programs, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor for sales for automatic-dimming rearview mirrors and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Magna International, is considerably larger than we are and may present a more formidable competitive threat in the future. Our future growth and success will depend on the ability to compete in our highly competitive markets.Our RCD Mirror feature competes in the market place with backup sensors and rear backup cameras (which could be in the rearview mirror, navigation system or other radio or multi-purpose displays). We believe that our RCD Mirror is an optimum, ergonomic, easily adaptable method to display the image produced by the rear camera for increased safety. Any color display in a vehicle is relatively costly, and when a color display is required for other features such as navigation, radio or other vehicle functions, then it may be less costly on a per-feature basis to display the output of the backup camera in that in-dash display, offering significant competition to the RCD Mirror. The long-term success of our RCD Mirror may depend on automakers' strategy in complying with the anticipated final rulemaking under the Cameron Gulbransen Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007 (which has now had four delays), and their willingness and desire to display other information in the RCD Mirror, driving down the per-feature cost.Our SmartBeam® product is a single-function driver-assist feature for headlamp lighting control that competes with multiple-function driver-assist features that include headlamp lighting control as one of the multiple functions. While we believe SmartBeam® is a low cost solution for a safety feature that makes nighttime driving safer by maximizing a vehicles high-beam usage, competition from multiple-function driver-assist products could impact the long-term success of the Company's expectations.  As the Company continues to expand the capabilities of its CMOS imager 15technology for additional driver-assist features, the Company recognizes that it is competing against multiple-function driver-assist technologies that could present a competitive threat for SmartBeam®.Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us with a competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors, although none of our patents individually is required for the success of our products. The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secrets regarding our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The lack of intellectual property protection is well-known in a number of countries, including China. This trend represents an increasing risk to technology companies in the United States, including Gentex.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement and damages against us could affect our profitability and future growth. If someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involved in our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increases these risks and makes such risk part of our on-going business. To that end, we periodically obtain intellectual property rights, in the ordinary course of business, to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio and minimize potential risks of infringement.  The increasing tendency of patents granted to others on combinations of known technology is a potential threat to our Company. Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations.New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significant portion of our annual sales in engineering, research and development projects as set forth in our Consolidated Statements of Income of our Consolidated Financial Statements filed with this report. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be adversely affected.Credit Risk. In light of the continuing financial stresses within the worldwide automotive industry, certain automakers and Tier 1 customers are considering the sale of certain business segments or may be considering bankruptcy. Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection of receivables, our business, financial condition, and/or results of operation. The current uncertain economic environment (especially in Europe) continues to cause increased financial pressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact timely customer payments and ultimately the collectability of receivables. Our overall allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financially distressed Tier 1 mirror customers. We continue to work with these financially distressed customers in collecting past due balances. Refer to Footnote 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.Supply Chain Disruptions. Due to the just-in-time supply chains within the automotive industry, a disruption in a supply chain caused by one or more of our suppliers and/or an unrelated tier one supplier due to part shortages, natural disasters, work stoppages, strikes, bankruptcy, etc. could disrupt our shipments to one or more automaker or Tier 1 customers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optic technology is performed at our five manufacturing facilities in Zeeland and Holland, Michigan. One of our manufacturing facilities is located in Holland, Michigan, which is approximately three miles from our other four manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provide other services would be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchased business interruption insurance to address some of these potential costs. Our inability to conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and/or results of operations include: •Changes in the commodity prices of the materials used in our products. We continue to experience pressure for select raw material cost increases. The Company did experience increased costs associated with supply chain constraints on certain automotive grade electronic components during the first half of calendar year 2012.  The costs associated with these particular supply chain constraint/disruptions appear to have been resolved, barring another natural disaster impacting the supply chain.16•Uncertain equity markets could negatively impact our financial performance due to an increase in realized losses on the sale of equity investments and/or recognized losses due to an Other-Than-Temporary impairment adjustment on available-for-sale securities (mark to market adjustment).•General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions in which we do business (especially in Europe) given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall, general economic conditions. Any continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and production levels.•We implemented the first phase of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System effective July 1, 2009, which covered key core business areas at our West Michigan locations. To date, we have not experienced any significant issues. In addition, we have implemented our new ERP system for one of our overseas offices effective December 1, 2009. To date, we have not experienced any significant issues. The implementation of additional lean manufacturing production line scheduling and business reporting capabilities are still in process as of December 31, 2012. While we believe that all necessary system development processes, testing procedures and user training that is planned will be adequate and completed prior to implementation, there is no guarantee that all system components will function as intended at the time of implementation. Unanticipated failure(s) could cause delays in our ability to produce or ship our products, process transactions, or otherwise conduct business in our markets, resulting in material financial risk.•Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our margins and profitability.•Obligations and costs associated with addressing quality issues or warranty claims could adversely affect our financial results.•The European New Car Assessment Program (Euro NCAP) provides an incentive to European automobile manufacturers to make safety technologies that include camera based driver assist features such as lane detection, vehicle detection, and pedestrian detection as standard equipment.  Euro NCAP compliant camera based driver assist systems are also capable of including high beam assist as a function.  The increased application of Euro NCAP on European vehicles can potentially have a negative impact on our SmartBeam® product by utilizing driver assist camera systems that include the high beam assist feature.  While the Company does continue product development and launch of new SmartBeam® and new driver assist camera products on European vehicles, the potential for increased competition may exist in the future.•The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries.  As a result, in August 2012 the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products.  These new requirements will require due diligence efforts in fiscal 2013, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in May 2014.  There will be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" conflict minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.•Our ability to attract or retain key employees to operate our manufacturing facilities and to staff our corporate office. We are dependent on the services of our management team. Losing key members of our management team could adversely affect our operations. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our officers or directors.17•Our ability to successfully design and execute strategic and operating plans, including continuing to obtain new business.Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the laws of Michigan include provisions that may provide our board of directors with adequate time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated, ranging from a low of $14.38 to a high of $31.40 during 2012. The overall market and the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our common stock due to, among other things including those discussed above: •variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of our competitors;•changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of the risks and conditions of our business and in particular our primary industry;•changes in investors’ or analysts’ perceptions of how the Kids Transportation Safety Act of 2007 (which has been delayed four times), and in particular the new rulemaking, may impact our business in the future;•intellectual property litigation and infringement claims;•the size of the public float of our common stock;•market conditions, including the industry in which we operate, and•general macroeconomic conditions (especially in Europe)"

These statements do notguarantee future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that aredifficult to predict with regard to timing, expense, likelihood and degree of occurrence. Theserisks include, without limitation, employment and general economic conditions, worldwide automotiveproduction, the maintenance of the Companys market share, the ability to achieve purchasing andengineering cost reductions, customer inventory management, supplier part shortages, competitivepricing pressures, currency fluctuations, interest rates, equity prices, the financialstrength/stability of the Companys customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers), supply chaindisruptions, potential sale of OEM business segments or suppliers, potential customer (includingtheir Tier 1 suppliers) bankruptcies, the mix of products purchased by customers, the ability tocontinue to make product innovations, the market for Rear Camera Display Mirrors and the success ofthose products, the success of certain other products (e.g. SmartBeam®) and other risks identifiedin the Companys other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, actualresults and outcomes may materially differ from what is expressed or forecasted. Furthermore, theCompany undertakes no obligation to update, amend, or clarify forward-looking statements, whetheras a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report onForm 10-K, should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. 98% of our net sales are to customers within the automotive industry.The automotive industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economicactivity. The current economic environment continues to be uncertain and continues to causeincreased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile production levels, supplier partshortages, customer and supplier financial issues, automotive plant shutdowns, commodity materialcost increases, consumer preference shift to smaller vehicles, where we have a lower penetrationrate and lower content per vehicle, due to environmental concerns and fuel costs. If automotivecustomers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) experience bankruptcies, work stoppages, strikes, partshortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affectour sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price. Automakers continue toexperience increased volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs which have, insome cases, resulted in cancellation or delays of new vehicle platforms, package reconfigurationsand inaccurate volume forecasts. This volatility and uncertainty has made it more difficult for usto forecast future sales, effectively manage costs and utilize capital, engineering, research anddevelopment, and human resource investments.Key Customers. We have a number of large customers, including three automotive customerswhich each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales (includes direct sales to OEM customersand sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): Toyota Motor Corporation, General Motors Corporationand Volkswagen/Audi. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases inproduction by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) would have amaterial adverse effect on our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price.Effective October 1, 2003, General Motors Corporation began including a 30-day escape clause intoits contracts in the event its suppliers are notcompetitive on pricing. Effective January 1, 2004, Ford Motor Company began imposing new contractterms, including the right to terminate a supplier contract for any or no reason. - 12 -Table of ContentsCredit Risk. In light of the continuing financial stresses within the worldwide automotiveindustry, certain automakers and Tier 1 customers are considering the sale of certain businesssegments or may be considering bankruptcy. Should one or more of our larger customers (includingsales through their Tier 1 suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adverselyaffect the collection of receivables, our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, our shareprice. The on-going uncertain economic environment continues to cause increased financialpressures and production stresses on our customers, which could impact timely customer payments andultimately the collectability of receivables.The Company has been paid for all pre-petition bankruptcy receivables relating to the GeneralMotors and Chrysler Chapter 11 bankruptcies in 2009.Our increased allowance for doubtful accounts in 2008 related to financially distressed Tier 1mirror customers. While we made progress in collecting a portion of the significantly past dueaccount balances from certain Tier 1 mirror customers, we did incur a bad debt write off ofapproximately $1.1 million in 2009, which was part of the 2008 increase in allowance for doubtfulaccounts. The remaining overall allowance for doubtful accounts primarily relates to financiallydistressed Tier 1 mirror customers. We continue to work with these financially distressedcustomers in collecting past due balances. Refer to Footnote 1 of the Consolidated FinancialStatements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtful accounts.Supply Chain Disruptions. Due to the just-in-time supply chains within the automotiveindustry, a disruption in a supply chain caused by an unrelated supplier due to bankruptcy, workstoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc. could disrupt our shipments to one or more automakercustomers, which could adversely affect our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, ourshare price.Pricing Pressures. In addition to price reductions over the life of our long-termagreements, we continue to experience significant pricing pressures from our automotive customersand competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our margins to the extentthat we are unable to offset the price reductions with engineering and purchasing cost reductions,productivity and manufacturing yield improvements, and increases in unit sales volume, each ofwhich pose a challenge. In addition, financial pressures at certain automakers are resulting inincreased cost reduction efforts by them, including requests for additional price reductions,decontenting certain features from vehicles, customer market testing of future business, dualsourcing initiatives and warranty cost-sharing programs, which could adversely impact our salesgrowth, margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price.Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor and a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of Magna International, is considerably larger than we are and may present a moreformidable competitive threat in the future. Our future growth and success will depend on theability to compete in our highly competitive markets.Our RCD Mirror feature competes in the market place with backup sensors and rear backup cameras(which could be in the rearview mirror, navigation system or other radio or multi-purposedisplays). We believe that our RCD Mirror is an optimum, ergonomic, easily adaptable method todisplay the output of a rear camera for increased safety. Ultrasonic sensors cost less but may beless effective. Any color display in a vehicle is relatively costly, and when a color display isrequired for other features such as navigation, radio or other vehicle functions, then it may beless costly on a per-feature basis to display the output of the backup camera in that in-dashdisplay, offering significant competition to the RCD Mirror. The long-term success of our RCDMirror may depend on automakers strategy in complying with the requirements of the KidsTransportation Safety Act of 2007, including recent rulemaking, and their willingness and desire todisplay other information in the RCD Mirror, driving down the per-feature cost.Our SmartBeam® product is a single function driver assist feature that competes with largeelectronics automotive suppliers who are marketing multi-function vision systems. Our singlefunction SmartBeam® feature is a cost competitive product when compared to other high-beam assistfeatures. While we expect SmartBeam® help drive growth over the next several years, competitioncould impact our expectations. As the Company continues to expand the capabilities of its CMOSimager technology for additional driver assist advanced-feature auto-dimming mirror products, theCompany recognizes that it is competing with considerably larger electronics companies as well,that could present a more formidable competitive threat in the future as new products/features arebrought to market.New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significant portion of ourannual sales in engineering, research and development projects as set forth in our ConsolidatedStatement of Income of our Consolidated FinancialStatements filed with this report. Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our sales,net income and, as a result, our share price will be adversely affected. - 13 -Table of ContentsIntellectual Property. We believe that our trade secrets and patents provide us with asignificant competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors (but none of our patentsindividually is required for the success of our products). The loss of any significant combinationof trade secrets and patents regarding our products could adversely affect our sales, margins,profitability and, as a result, share price.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim of patent orother intellectual property infringement against us could affect our profitability and futuregrowth. If someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, anyresulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention ofmanagement and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involvedin our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation significantly increasesthese risks. Any of these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employing electro-optictechnology is performed at our five manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. In December2010, we purchased an additional manufacturing facility in Holland, Michigan, which isapproximately three miles from our other manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan. Should acatastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders and provideother services would be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We have purchasedbusiness interruption insurance to address some of these potential costs. Our inability to conductnormal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on our business,financial condition, and results of operations.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our sales, margins,profitability and, as a result, our share price include:  Uncertain equity markets could negatively impact our financial performance due toan increase in realized losses on the sale of equity investments and/or recognizedlosses due to an other-than-temporary impairment adjustment on available-for-salesecurities (mark to market adjustment).  Changes in the commodity prices of the materials used in our products. Wecontinue to experience pressure for select raw material cost increases. The Company isalso experiencing increased costs associated with supply chain constraints on certainautomotive grade electronic components. We anticipate that the supply chain constraintswill persist into the first half of calendar year 2011.  General economic conditions continue to be of concern in many of the regions inwhich we do business given that our primary industry is greatly impacted by overall,general economic conditions. Continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currencyexchange rates, war or significant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwideautomotive sales and production levels.  We implemented the first phase of a new Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systemeffective July 1, 2009, which covered key core business areas at our Zeeland, Michiganlocations. To date, we have not experienced any significant issues. In addition, wehave implemented our new ERP system for one of its overseas offices effective December1, 2009. To date, we have not experienced any significant issues. The implementationof additional lean manufacturing production line scheduling and business reportingcapabilities are still in process as of December 31, 2010. While we believe that allnecessary system development processes, testing procedures and user training that isplanned will be adequate and completed prior to implementation, there is no guaranteethat all system components will function as intended at the time of implementation.Unanticipated failure(s) could cause delays in our ability to produce or ship ourproducts, process transactions, or otherwise conduct business in our markets, resultingin material financial risk.  Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our margins and profitability.  Our ability to attract or retain key employees to operate our manufacturingfacilities and to staff our corporate office. We are dependent on the services of ourmanagement team. Losing key members of our management team could adversely affect ouroperations. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our officers ordirectors.  Our ability to successfully design and execute strategic and operating plans,including continuing to obtain new business. - 14 -Table of ContentsAntitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, the laws of Michigan,and our Shareholder Protection Rights Plan include provisions which are designed to provide ourboard of directors with time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in our best interestand the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, could discourage potentialacquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. In addition, such provisionscould diminish the opportunities for a holder of our common stock to participate in tender offers,including tender offers at a price above the then current price for our common stock. Theseprovisions could also, if our Board of Directors determines that is in the best interest of ourCompany and our shareholders, prevent transactions in which our shareholders might otherwisereceive a premium for their shares over then current market prices, and may limit the ability ofour shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.All of these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing, if our Board of Directorsdetermines that is in the best interest of our Company and our shareholders, a change in control atthe company level without action by our shareholders, and therefore, could adversely affect theprice of our common stock.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated,ranging from a low of $16.54 to a high of $30.36 during 2010. The overall market and the price ofour common stock may continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market pricefor our common stock due to, among other things:  variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of ourcompetitors;  changes in investors or analysts perceptions of the risks and conditions of ourbusiness and in particular our primary industry;  changes in investors or analysts perceptions of how the Kids TransportationSafety Act of 2007, and in particular the new rulemaking, may impact our business in thefuture;   the size of the public float of our common stock;   market conditions, including the industry in which we operate, and   general economic conditions"

Therefore, actual results andoutcomes may materially differ from what is expressed or forecasted. Furthermore, the Companyundertakes no obligation to update, amend, or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as aresult of new information, future events, or otherwise.The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Report onForm 10-K, should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. 97% of our net sales are to customers within the automotive industry.The current state of the automotive industry has been well publicized and the auto industry hasalways been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity. The current environment(global recession, credit crisis, decline in consumer confidence, government loans to certain OEMsthat require certain conditions to be met) continues to be uncertain and continues to causeincreased financial and production stresses evidenced by volatile production levels, supplier partshortages, customer and supplier bankruptcies, automotive plant shutdowns, commodity material costincreases, consumer preference shift to smaller vehicles due to fuel costs and environmentalconcerns where we have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle. If additionalautomotive customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) experience bankruptcies, work stoppages,strikes, part shortages, etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which couldadversely affect our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price. Automakerscontinue to experience increased volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs whichhave, in some cases, resulted in cancellation or delays of new vehicle platforms, packagereconfigurations and inaccurate volume forecasts. This volatility and uncertainty has made it moredifficult for us to forecast future sales, effectively manage costs and utilize capital,engineering, research and development, and human resource investments.The global governmental vehicle stimulus programs, such as the Cash for Clunkers program in theUnited Stated, did not have a significant direct effect on our production levels in 2009, since thesmaller vehicles that people were mostly purchasing were those that typically did not containsignificant Gentex content. However, there may have been some indirect effect due to the increasedshowroom traffic that those programs created. While the governmental stimulus programs were ineffect, automotive vehicle sales were temporarily higher than automotive production levels. Nowthat sales levels have decreased and the scenario has reversed, automakers, at some point, webelieve, will need to adjust their production plans for the lower sales levels.  - 11 - Table of ContentsKey Customers. We have a number of large customers, including six automotive customerswhich each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales (includes direct sales to OEM customersand sales through their Tier 1 suppliers): ToyotaMotor Corporation, Volkswagen/Audi, General Motors Corporation, Daimler AG, Ford and BMW. The lossof all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases in production by, any of thesecustomers (or certain other significant customers) would have a material adverse effect on oursales, margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price. Toyota Motor Corporation recentlyannounced a number of vehicle recalls that will impact their production in the near term. Theimpact to Gentex will depend upon the length and depth of their production cuts resulting from theannounced vehicle recalls. To date, the impact is not material. Effective October 1, 2003,General Motors Corporation began including a 30-day escape clause into its contracts in the eventits suppliers are not competitive on pricing. Effective January 1, 2004, Ford Motor Company beganimposing new contract terms, including the right to terminate a supplier contract for any or noreason.Credit Risk. In light of the continuing well publicized financial stresses within theworldwide automotive industry, certain automakers have filed for bankruptcy and other automakersand Tier 1 mirror customers are considering bankruptcy and/or the sale of certain businesssegments. Should one or more of our larger customers (including sales through their Tier 1suppliers) declare bankruptcy or sell their business, it could adversely affect the collection ofreceivables, our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price. The on-goinguncertain economic environment continues to cause increased financial pressures and productionstresses on our customers, which could impact timely customer payments and ultimately thecollectability of receivables.We have been paid for all pre-petition bankruptcy receivables relating to Chrysler who filed forbankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on April 30, 2009. Wehave also received payment for all pre-petition bankruptcy receivables relating to General Motorswho filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on June1, 2009.Our increased allowance for doubtful accounts in 2008 related to financially distressed Tier 1mirror customers. While we have made progress in collecting a portion of the significantly pastdue account balances from certain Tier 1 mirror customers, we did incur a bad debt write off ofapproximately $1.1 million in 2009, which was part of the 2008 increase in allowance for doubtfulaccounts. The remaining overall allowance for doubtful accounts related to all financiallydistressed Tier 1 mirror customers remains unchanged. We continue to work with certain financiallydistressed Tier 1 mirror customers in collecting past due balances. Refer to Footnote 1 of theConsolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding our allowance for doubtfulaccounts.Supply Chain Disruptions. Due to the just-in-time supply chains within the automotiveindustry, a disruption in a supply chain caused by an unrelated supplier due to bankruptcy, workstoppages, strikes, part shortages, etc. could disrupt our shipments to one or more automakercustomers, which could adversely affect our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, ourshare price.Pricing Pressures.

The long-term success of our RCD Mirror may depend on automakers willingnessand desire to display other information in the RCD Mirror, driving down the per-feature cost.  - 12 - Table of ContentsOur SmartBeam® product is a single function feature that competes with large electronic automotivesuppliers who are marketing multi-function vision systems. Our single function SmartBeam® featureis a cost competitive product when compared to other high-beam assist features. While we expectRCD Mirrors and SmartBeam® to drive growth over the next several years, competition could impactour expectations.New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significant portion of ourannual sales in engineering, research and development projects as set forth in our ConsolidatedStatement of Income of our Consolidated Financial Statements filed with this report.

Therefore actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what is expressed orforecasted. Furthermore, the Company undertakes no obligation to update, amend, or clarifyforward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.The following risk factors, together with all other information provided in this Annual Reporton Form 10-K, should be carefully considered.Automotive Industry. 96% of our net sales are to customers within the automotiveindustry. The current state of the automotive industry has been well publicized, including thefederal governments loans to certain OEMs (which require certain conditions be met). While theauto industry has always been cyclical and highly impacted by levels of economic activity, thecurrent environment (global recession, credit crisis, decline in consumer confidence) isunprecedented and is causing increased financial and production stresses evidenced by continuingpricing pressures, lower production levels, consumer preference shift to smaller vehicles due tofuel costs where we have a lower penetration rate and lower content per vehicle, overcapacity,customer and supplier bankruptcies, and commodity material cost increases. If our automotivecustomers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) experience bankruptcies, work stoppages, strikes,etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adversely affect our sales,margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price. More than ever before, automakers havebeen experiencing increased volatility and uncertainty in executing planned new programs whichhave, in some cases, resulted in cancellation or delays of new vehicle platforms, packagereconfigurations and inaccurate volume forecasts. This increased volatility and uncertainty hasmade it moredifficult for us to forecast future sales, effectively manage costs and utilize capital,engineering, research and development, and human resource investments. - 13 - Key Customers. We have several large customers, including five customers which eachaccount for 10% or more of our annual net sales (includes direct sales to OEM customers and salesthrough their Tier 1 suppliers): Daimler AG, General Motors Corporation, Toyota Motor Corporation,Volkswagen/Audi and BMW. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales to, or decreases inproduction by, any of these customers (or certain other significant customers) would have amaterial adverse effect on our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price.Effective October 1, 2003, General Motors Corporation began including a 30-day escape clause intoits contracts in the event its suppliers are not competitive on pricing. Effective January 1,2004, Ford Motor Company began imposing new contract terms, including the right to terminate asupplier contract for any or no reason.Pricing Pressures. In addition to price reductions over the life of our long-termagreements, we continue to experience significant pricing pressures from our automotive customersand competitors, which have affected, and which will continue to affect our margins to the extentthat we are unable to offset the price reductions with productivity and manufacturing yieldimprovements, engineering and purchasing cost reductions, and increases in unit sales volume, allof which continue to be a challenge in the current automotive production environment. In addition,financial pressures at certain automakers are resulting in increased cost reduction efforts bythem, including requests for additional price reductions, decontenting certain features fromvehicles, customer market testing of future business, dual sourcing initiatives and warrantycost-sharing programs, any of which could adversely impact our sales growth, margins, profitabilityand, as a result, our share price.Credit Risk. In light of the well publicized financial stresses within the worldwideautomotive industry, certain automakers and tier one mirror customers are considering bankruptcyand/or the sale of business segments. Should one or more of our larger customers (including salesthrough their Tier 1 suppliers) sell their business or declare bankruptcy, it could adverselyaffect the collection of receivables, our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, our shareprice. The current uncertain economic environment continues to cause increased financial pressuresand production stresses on our customers, which could impact timely customer payments andultimately the collectibility of receivables.Supply Chain Disruptions. Due to the just-in-time supply chains within the automotiveindustry, a disruption in a supply chain caused by an unrelated supplier due to bankruptcy, workstoppages, strikes, etc. could disrupt our shipments to one or more automaker customers, whichcould adversely affect our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price.Competition. We recognize that Magna Mirrors, our main competitor and a wholly-ownedsubsidiary of Magna International, is considerably larger than our Company and may present a moreformidable competitive threat in the future. Our future growth and success will depend on theability to compete in our highly competitive markets.New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significant portionof our annual sales in engineering, research and development projects as set forth in ourConsolidated Statement of Income of our Consolidated Financial Statements filed with this report.Should these efforts ultimately prove unsuccessful, our sales, net income and, as a result, ourshare price will be adversely affected.Intellectual Property. We believe that our patents and trade secrets provide us witha significant competitive advantage in automotive rearview mirrors. The loss of any significantcombination of patents and trade secrets could adversely affect our sales, margins, profitabilityand, as a result, share price.Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successful claim ofpatent or other intellectual property infringement against us could affect our profitability andgrowth. If someone claims that our products infringed their intellectual property rights, anyresulting litigation could be costly and time consuming and would divert the attention ofmanagement and key personnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involvedin our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increases these risks. Anyof these adverse consequences could potentially have an effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations. - 14 - Business Disruptions. Manufacturing of our proprietary products employingelectro-optic technology are performed at our five manufacturing facilities in Zeeland, Michigan.Should a catastrophic event occur, our ability to manufacture product, complete existing orders andprovide other services would be severely impacted for an undetermined period of time. We havepurchased business interruption insurance to address some of these potential costs. Our inabilityto conduct normal business operations for a period of time may have an adverse impact on ourbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.Other. Other issues and uncertainties which could adversely impact our sales,margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price include:  The Company has evaluated and is planning to implement a new Enterprise ResourcePlanning (ERP) System in 2009. While we believe that all necessary system developmentprocesses, testing procedures and user training that is planned will be adequate andcompleted prior to final implementation, there is no guarantee that all system componentswill function as intended at the date of implementation/conversion. Unanticipatedfailure(s) could cause delays in our ability to produce or ship its products, processtransactions, or otherwise conduct business in its markets, resulting in materialfinancial risk.    Economic conditions have deteriorated in many of the regions in which we do business.Continued adverse worldwide economic conditions, currency exchange rates, war orsignificant terrorist acts, could each affect worldwide automotive sales and productionlevels.    Changes in the commodity prices of the materials used in our products. We continueto experience some pressure for select raw material cost increases.    Manufacturing yield issues may negatively impact our margins and profitability.    Our ability to attract or retain key employees to operate our manufacturingfacilities and to staff our corporate office. We are dependent on the services of ourmanagement team. Losing key members of our management team could adversely affect ouroperations. We do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our officers ordirectors.    Uncertain equity markets could negatively impact our financial performance due to anincrease in realized losses on the sale of equity investments and/or recognized losses dueto an other-thantemporary impairment adjustment on available-for-sale securities (mark tomarket adjustment).    Our ability to successfully design and execute strategic and operating plans,including continuing to obtain new business.Antitakeover Provisions. Our articles of incorporation and bylaws, the laws ofMichigan, and our Shareholder Protection Rights Plan include provisions which are designed toprovide our board of directors with time to consider whether a hostile takeover offer is in ourbest interest and the best interests of our shareholders. These provisions, however, coulddiscourage potential acquisition proposals and could delay or prevent a change in control. Theprovisions also could diminish the opportunities for a holder of our common stock to participate intender offers, including tender offers at a price above the then current price for our commonstock. These provisions could also prevent transactions in which our shareholders might otherwisereceive a premium for their shares over then current market prices, and may limit the ability ofour shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests.All of these provisions may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control atthe company level without action by our shareholders, and therefore, could adversely affect theprice of our common stock.Fluctuations in Market Price. The market price for our common stock has fluctuated,ranging between $19.47 and $6.50 during 2008. The overall market and the price of our common stockmay continue to fluctuate. There may be a significant impact on the market price for our commonstock due to, among other things:  variations in our anticipated or actual operating results or the results of ourcompetitors;    changes in investors or analysts perceptions of the risks and conditions of ourbusiness and in particular our primary industry;    the size of the public float of our common stock;    market conditions, including the industry in which we operate, and    general economic conditions"

The following risk factors, together with all other information provided inthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered.     Automotive Industry. 96% of our net sales are to customers within theautomotive industry. Supplying products to the automotive industry involvesincreasing financial and production stresses due to continuing pricingpressures, lower domestic production levels, overcapacity, customer and supplierbankruptcies, and commodity material cost increases. If the Company's automotivecustomers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) experience work stoppages, strikes,etc., it could disrupt our shipments to these customers, which could adverselyaffect the Company's sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, its shareprice. Automakers have been experiencing increased volatility and uncertainty inexecuting planned new programs which have, in some cases, resulted incancellation or delays of new vehicle platforms, package reconfigurations andinaccurate volume forecasts. This increased volatility and uncertainty has madeit more difficult for us to forecast future sales and effectively utilizecapital, engineering, research and development, and human resource investments.     Key Customers. We have a few large customers, including four customerswhich each account for 10% or more of our annual net sales (including sales totheir Tier 1 suppliers): General Motors Corporation, Daimler AG, Toyota MotorCorporation and BMW. The loss of all or a substantial portion of the sales toany of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our sales,margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price. Effective October 1,2003, General Motors Corporation, our largest customer, began including a 30-dayescape clause into its contracts in the event its suppliers are not competitiveon pricing. Effective January 1, 2004, Ford Motor Company began imposing newcontract terms, including the right to terminate a supplier contract for any orno reason, etc.     Pricing Pressures. In addition to price reductions over the life of ourlong-term agreements, we continue to experience pricing pressures from ourautomotive customers and competitors, which have affected, and which willcontinue to affect our margins to the extent that we are unable to offset theprice reductions with productivity and manufacturing yield improvements,engineering and purchasing cost reductions, and increases in unit sales volume,which has been a challenge. In addition, profit pressures at certain automakersare resulting in increased cost reduction efforts by them, including requestsfor additional price reductions, decontenting certain features from vehicles,and warranty cost-sharing programs, any of which could adversely impact oursales growth, margins, profitability and, as a result, our share price.     Credit Risk. In light of the financial stresses within the worldwideautomotive industry, certain automakers and tier one mirror customers areconsidering the sale of business segments or may be considering bankruptcy.Should one or more of our larger                                      -13-customers (including their Tier 1 suppliers) sell their business or declarebankruptcy, it could adversely affect our sales, margins, profitability and, asa result, the Company's share price.     Supply Chain Disruptions.

Competition. We recognize that Magna Donnelly, our main competitor and awholly-owned subsidiary of Magna International, is considerably larger than ourCompany and may present a more formidable competitive threat in the future. Ourfuture growth and success will depend on the ability to compete in our highlycompetitive markets.     New Technology and Product Development. We continue to invest a significantportion of our annual sales in engineering, research and development projects asset forth in our Consolidated Statement of Income of our Consolidated FinancialStatements filed with this report.

The loss of any significant combination of patents and trade secretscould adversely affect our sales, margins, profitability and, as a result, shareprice.     Intellectual Property Litigation and Infringement Claims. A successfulclaim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us couldaffect our profitability and growth. If someone claims that our productsinfringed their intellectual property rights, any resulting litigation could becostly and time consuming and would divert the attention of management and keypersonnel from other business issues. The complexity of the technology involvedin our business and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigationincreases these risks.
