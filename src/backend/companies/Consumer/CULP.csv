2,CULP,CULP INC,2023-07-14,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. In addition to the matters described above under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information,” set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause a material adverse change in our results of operations, financial condition, or future prospects. The risks described below should be carefully considered, together with other information provided in this report, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements, including the related notes. The risks discussed below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods. Macroeconomic, Market, and Strategic RisksContinued economic and industry uncertainty could negatively affect our sales and earnings.Overall demand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding products, which is subject to cyclical variations in the general economy, including current inflationary pressures affecting consumer spending, declines in overall consumer confidence, recession and fears of recession, the negative economic impact of potential additional surges of the coronavirus, and other geopolitical events, such as the ongoing Russia/Ukraine war. Because purchases of furniture and bedding products may be considered discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products may be more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products. Economic downturns, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about future health and economic prospects can affect consumer spending habits and demand for discretionary items, including home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decline in our sales and earnings. In addition, the level of housing starts, sales of existing homes, trends in disposable income, changes in interest rates (particularly home mortgage rates), and availability of consumer credit, can also affect our business. While we saw an adverse impact from some of these measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of fiscal 2020 and the beginning of fiscal 2021, we experienced increased demand in our mattress fabrics segment and in the residential side of our upholstery fabrics segment for most of fiscal 2021, driven by greater consumer focus on the home environment and more discretionary spending being allocated to home furnishings in the face of travel restrictions and other pandemic-related factors. However, this trend began to reverse during fiscal 2022, particularly during the second half of the year, as COVID-related travel and mask restrictions were lifted and consumers began to resume travel and leisure activities. We believe the trend of increased consumer discretionary spending on travel, leisure, and entertainment, and away from home goods, continued throughout fiscal 2023. Inflationary pressures also began to affect consumer spending during the second half of fiscal 2022 and continuing throughout fiscal 2023. We are unable to predict how long these trends will last, or to what extent additional surges of the coronavirus or other geopolitical events may affect the economic and purchasing cycle for home furnishing products (and therefore affect demand for our products) over the short and long term. Loss of market share due to competition would result in declines in sales and could result in losses or decreases in earnings.Our business is highly competitive and fragmented, and we face significant competition from many competitors, both foreign and domestic. We compete with many other manufacturers of fabric, as well as converters who source fabrics from various producers and market them to manufacturers of furniture and bedding. In many cases, these fabrics are sourced from foreign suppliers who have a lower cost structure than the company. The highly competitive nature of our business in each of our segments means we are constantly subject to the risk of losing market share, which would likely result in a loss or decrease our future sales and earnings. As a result of increased competition, there have been deflationary pressures on the prices for many of our products, which make it more difficult to pass along increased operating costs such as raw materials, shipping, energy, foreign currency fluctuations, or labor in the form of price increases, which puts downward pressure on our profit margins. Also, the wide range of product offerings in our business can make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design, styling, finish, and other techniques.The global COVID-19 pandemic significantly and adversely affected, and may again adversely affect, our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected the global and U.S. economy, severely disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, all of which negatively affected the bedding and home furnishings industries, our customers and suppliers, and our business. Many countries, including the countries in which we operate, as well as state and local governmental authorities, took various actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including mandated closures of businesses, stay-at-home orders, quarantine and isolation requirements, travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, social distancing measures, occupancy limits, and other safety measures. While these restrictions have now been lifted as conditions have improved, the restrictions adversely affected our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Due to government-mandated closure requirements near the end of March 2020, we shut down our facilities in Canada and Haiti for several weeks. At the same time, we experienced a rapid decline in demand as customers and retail stores began closing or substantially 15 limiting their operations. We took a number of measures in response to the increasingly challenging market conditions, including, among other things, repurposing a portion of our available operations to produce face masks, bedding covers, and fabrics for healthcare operations and consumer health; reducing operating costs by implementing temporary salary reductions, making workforce adjustments to align with demand, suspending merit pay increases, and eliminating the cash compensation paid to our board of directors; aggressively reducing expenses, capital expenditures, and discretionary spending, and working with our vendors and landlords to negotiate temporary terms. We also took steps to safeguard the health of our employees, customers, and the communities we serve, including implementing detailed cleaning and disinfecting processes at our facilities, instituting temperature checks, adhering to social distancing and mask protocols, suspending non-essential travel, restricting visitors, providing remote work opportunities where possible, and offering on-site vaccination clinics to our employees, their families, and the general public. We have continued to monitor and update these procedures, in accordance with CDC recommendations and other local laws and regulatory authorities, throughout the pandemic. While the COVID-19 pandemic continued to spread throughout the world during fiscal 2021, we did not experience additional closures of any of our operations, or any material closures of the operations of our suppliers, during the remainder of the fiscal year, following the initial shutdowns from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, during fiscal 2022, our upholstery fabrics business was materially affected by COVID-19 related shutdowns of our sourcing partners and customers in Vietnam throughout most of the second quarter, and our operations in China were shut down during the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and continuing to some extent during the first month of fiscal 2023, which prevented us from shipping goods in both our residential upholstery fabrics business and our sewn mattress cover business. In addition to these shutdowns, COVID-19 disruption affected our business during fiscal 2022, as well as the business of our customers and suppliers, due to employee absenteeism and labor shortages, pandemic-related effects on the availability and pricing of freight and raw material costs, and pandemic-related constraints on our customers’ capacity due to supply chain disruption for non-fabric components. We did not experience additional closures of any of our operations, or any material closures of the operations of our suppliers, during the remainder of fiscal 2023. While the World Health Organization has now declared an official end to the COVID-19 global health emergency, future surges in the number of COVID-19 cases and preventative or protective actions that governmental authorities or we may take in response to such surges may have an adverse effect on our business or the business of our customers, suppliers, or distribution channels, including additional business shutdowns, reduced operations, restrictions on shipping or installing products, reduced consumer demand, reduced availability and/or higher pricing of materials, or the ability of our customers to make payments. In addition, responding to future case surges or restrictions could divert management’s attention from our key strategic priorities, increase costs as we prioritize the health and safety of our employees and customers, cause us to reduce, delay, alter, or abandon strategic initiatives that may otherwise increase our long-term value, and otherwise disrupt our business operations. The potential for future surges in the number of COVID-19 cases and the impact of such surges on our business depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of such surges; actions taken to contain spread of the virus and mitigate the public health and economic effects; vaccine availability and effectiveness within the markets in which we operate; the impact on global supply chain conditions; employee absenteeism and labor shortages; and the short- and long-term disruption to the global economy, consumer confidence, demand for home furnishings products, unemployment, and the financial health of our customers, suppliers, and distribution channels. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the impact of such potential future COVID-19 surges on our business or on our future financial or operational results; however, the disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows over time. Furthermore, the impact of additional surges in COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A – Risk Factors
, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, if in the future there is an outbreak of another highly infectious disease or other health concern or epidemic, we may be subject to similar risks as those faced during the COVID-19 pandemic.Our operations are subject to risks of unsettled political conditions, civil unrest or instability, public health concerns or pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, acts of war, terrorism, and the effects of climate change, any one of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our domestic and foreign operations are subject to risks of unsettled political conditions, civil unrest or instability, public health concerns or pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, acts of war, and terrorism. In addition, the effects of climate change and actions taken to combat climate change could exacerbate these risks, including by increasing the likelihood and severity of extreme weather events. Any of these risks, including without limitation civil unrest or instability in Haiti, China, or other countries where we operate, could cause disruption at our manufacturing or distribution facilities, or at the facilities of our suppliers and distribution channels, which could make servicing our customers more difficult and could reduce our sales, earnings, or both in the future.16 Operational RisksOur business may be adversely affected by increased tariffs or other changes in U.S. trade policy related to imported products, as well as violations of existing trade policies.Many of our products are manufactured or sourced outside of the United States. The U.S. government has imposed certain tariffs on imports from various countries, including China, where a significant amount of our products is produced. In the future, the U.S. Government may consider imposing additional tariffs or extending the timeline for continuation of existing tariffs. Any tariffs that result in increased costs of imported products and materials could require us to increase prices to our domestic customers or, if we are unable to do so, result in lowering our gross margins on products sold. As a result, the tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition to tariffs, the U.S. government considers other proposals for substantial changes to its trade and tax policies, which could include import restrictions, increased import tariffs, changes to or withdrawal from existing trade agreements, and border-adjustment taxes, among other possible measures. Material changes in these policies could increase our tax obligations, require us to source materials from different regions, or increase prices to customers, which could adversely affect sales. Any significant change in U.S. trade or tax policy related to imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.There are also a number of trade regulations and duties currently in place to protect the U.S. textile industry against competition from low-priced foreign producers, such as those in China and Vietnam, but violations of these trade regulations and duties has had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our operations. In May of 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed punitive anti-dumping measures against China mattress imports to address violations of trade regulations. Despite the imposition of these duties, if China producers move their production out of China, which we believe has already occurred, they may continue to engage in unfair competition in violation of trade regulations between the U.S. and other countries, or there may be a potential risk of illegal transshipments of mattress products into the United States, which involves circumventing the imposed duties by falsely claiming that mattresses are products of a particular country of origin to avoid paying higher duties. Also, if supply chains are moved out of China to countries without anti-dumping duties and producers continue to supply low-priced imports in violation of U.S. trade laws, and if illegal transshipments are not monitored and enforcement is not effective to limit them, these shipments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. During fiscal 2020, the U.S. mattress industry was affected by continued disruption relating to low-priced mattress imports that moved from China to other countries, which affected demand for our products. As a result, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed anti-dumping duties on mattress imports from seven of these countries during fiscal 2021. We believe the domestic mattress industry and, in turn, our business, began to realize some benefits from these duties during the second half of fiscal 2021 and continuing into fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023. However, despite the imposition of these duties, supply chains could move out of the affected countries to other countries without anti-dumping duties and continue supplying low-priced imports in violation of U.S. trade laws, or there may be a potential risk of illegal transshipments of mattress products from these countries to avoid paying the higher duties, which could negatively affect our business. Greater reliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or raw materials increases the likelihood of disruptions to our supply chain or our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis.We rely significantly on operations in distant locations, especially China. In addition, we have been purchasing a significant share of our products and raw materials from offshore sources, particularly Asia and Turkey. At the same time, our domestic manufacturing capacity for the upholstery fabrics segment continues to decline. These changes have caused us to rely on an extended supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do not control, both of which are inherently subject to greater risks of delay or disruption. In addition, operations and sourcing in foreign areas are subject to the risk of changing local governmental rules, taxes, changes in import rules or customs, import restrictions, tariffs, shipping rates, potential political unrest and instability, coronavirus or other pandemic-related closure rules, or other threats that could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in foreign areas or sourcing products overseas. Additionally, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies can affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United States. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could make our products less competitive on the basis of price in markets outside the United States, and strengthening of currencies in Canada and China could have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those places. Any of the risks associated with foreign operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could have a negative impact on our ultimate financial results.Specifically with respect to sourcing products and raw materials from third-party suppliers in China, our ability to timely or successfully import such products or products made with such raw materials may be adversely affected by changes in U.S. laws.  For example, the U.S. Government has taken several steps to address forced labor concerns in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China (""XUAR""), including sanctions on specific entities and individuals; withhold release orders (""WROs"") issued by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (""CBP"") that prohibit the entry of imports of certain items from XUAR; and the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (""UFLPA""), which went into effect in June 2022 and imposes a presumptive ban on the import of goods to the U.S. that are made, wholly or in part, in the XUAR or by persons that participate in certain programs in the XUAR that entail the use of forced labor. CBP 17 has published both a list of entities that are known to utilize forced labor and a list of commodities that are most at risk, such as cotton, tomatoes and silica-based products. The UFLPA specifically targets cotton and the apparel and textile industries as high-priority sectors for enforcement. None of our Chinese suppliers are located in the XUAR, and we prohibit our suppliers from doing business with or sourcing inputs from any company or entity that is restricted under U.S. or other applicable law. However, as a result of the UFLPA and WROs, products we import into the U.S. could be held for inspection by CBP based on a suspicion that such products or inputs used in such products originated from the XUAR or that they may have been produced by Chinese suppliers accused of participating in forced labor, pending our providing satisfactory evidence to the contrary. During fiscal 2023, we were subjected to a limited number of such CBP detentions and were successful in submitting satisfactory supply chain evidence to result in the release of all such detained good by CBP. These detentions have not resulted in any material impact on our business, supply chain,  customer relationships, or reputation. However, future detentions could result in unexpected (i) delays or rejections of products scheduled for delivery to us, which could in turn affect the timing or our ability to delivery products to our customers; (ii) supply chain disruptions and increased operating costs; (iii) damage to our customer relationships; and/or (iv) negative publicity that harms our reputation, any of which could have a material impact on our business and negatively affect our ultimate financial results.Our business faces several risks associated with doing business in ChinaWe source a variety of fabrics, as well as cut and sewn upholstery kits and sewn mattress covers, from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China. We also operate two upholstery manufacturing facilities and two warehouse facilities in Shanghai, China. The Chinese economy is characterized by extensive state ownership, control, and regulation, and the political, legal, and economic climate in China is fluid and unpredictable. Therefore, our business is continually subject to the risk of changes in Chinese laws and regulations that could have an adverse effect on our suppliers and manufacturing operations. Any changes in policies governing tariffs, imports and exports, taxation, inflation, economic sanctions and export controls, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property, network security, intellectual property, and financial regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, the Chinese legal system is continuing to develop and evolve, and the enforcement of rules and regulations is not always consistent or uniform. Moreover, any potential civil unrest, natural disasters, or other threats could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in China. The Chinese economy poses additional risks to our business, including fluctuating rates of inflation and currency exchange rates, a declining labor force participation rate, and rising employee wages. In addition, changes in the political climate or trade policy of the United States, such as increased duties, tariffs, or U.S. restrictions on Chinese imports, such as the UFLPA, may adversely affect our business. Our ability to operate in China has also been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and may in the future be negatively affected by additional surges in the coronavirus or other diseases. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, China from time to time enforced broad lockdowns, which affected our ability to timely produce and ship products and affected the ability of our third-party suppliers and their supply chain to timely deliver products and materials. Any of the risks associated with our Chinese operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively affect our ultimate financial results.We may have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements being used for products and services.We rely on outside sources for various products and services, including yarn and other raw materials, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics, cut and sewn upholstery kits, sewn mattress covers, and services such as weaving and finishing. Increased reliance on outsourcing lowers our capital investment and fixed costs, but it decreases the amount of control that we have over certain elements of our production capacity. Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw materials or other required products or services from our outside suppliers on a timely and cost-effective basis, especially if alternative suppliers cannot be immediately obtained, could disrupt our production and damage our financial results.18 Write-offs or write-downs of assets would result in a decrease in our earnings and shareholders’ equity. The company has assets, primarily consisting of property, plant and equipment, right of use assets, inventory, and intangible assets, that may be subject to write-offs or write-downs. ASC Topic 360 establishes an impairment accounting model for long-lived assets, including property, plant, and equipment, right of use assets, and finite-lived intangible assets such as customer relationships and our non-compete agreement. It requires the company to assess these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered. In accordance with ASC Topic 330, management continuously examines inventory to determine if there are indicators that the carrying value exceeds its net realizable value. Experience has shown that the most significant of such indicators are the age of the inventory and planned discontinuances of certain patterns. ASC Topic 350 establishes an impairment model for indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our tradename, which must be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered.Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition, and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Any of such future actions could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and there is no assurance that future write-downs of fixed assets or other intangible assets will not occur if business conditions were to deteriorate.As a result of inventory impairment assessments conducted during fiscal 2023, we incurred non-cash inventory charges totaling $5.8 million, which represents a $2.9 million impairment charge associated with our mattress fabrics segment; a total of $2.8 million related to markdowns of inventory in both segments that were estimated based on our policy for aged inventory; and $98,000 for the loss on disposal and markdowns of inventory related to the exit of our cut and sewn upholstery fabrics operation located in Shanghai, China. We incurred non-cash inventory charges of $1.9 million and $882,000 during fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, which represent markdowns of inventory in both segments that were based on our policy of aged inventory. See Notes 5, 7, and  9 of the consolidated financial statements for further details of our assessments of impairment, conclusions reached, and the performance of our quantitative tests. Write-offs and write-downs of our assets, including inventory, result in an immediate charge to our earnings, and can have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.Changes in the price, availability, and quality of raw materials could increase our costs or cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would result in decreased earnings.We depend upon outside suppliers for most of our raw material needs, and we rely upon outside suppliers for component materials such as yarn, unfinished fabrics, and cut and sewn upholstery kits and mattress covers, as well as for certain services such as finishing and weaving. Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of these goods and services have had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on our production costs and ability to meet the demands of our customers, which can affect our ability to generate sales and earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass through increased costs of raw materials or increased production costs to our customers through price increases. In particular, many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our material costs are especially sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. Increases in prices for oil, petrochemical products or other raw materials and services provided by outside suppliers can significantly increase our costs and negatively affect our profit margins and earnings. During fiscal 2021, our raw material costs were mostly flat or slightly lower during the first three quarters of the year, but prices began to escalate during the fourth quarter primarily due to rising oil prices, a higher demand environment, and labor shortages. These pressures continued during fiscal 2022, with further increases in raw material costs, particularly during the second half of the year, due to the continued rise in oil prices and a higher demand environment. During fiscal 2023, the cost of raw materials began to decline during the first half of the year due to lower oil prices and slowing global demand, but the higher costs and lower availability of labor remained challenging throughout the year.  Raw material costs were relatively stable during the second half of fiscal 2023. However, the pressures that affect raw material costs may drive additional increases in raw material prices in the future. Increases in energy costs increase our operating costs and could adversely affect earnings.Higher prices for electricity, natural gas, and fuel increase our production and shipping costs. A significant shortage, increased prices, or interruptions in the availability of these energy sources would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers and would be likely to adversely affect our earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass along the full extent of increases in our production costs to customers through price increases. Energy costs have varied significantly during recent fiscal years and remain a volatile element of our costs. Increases in energy costs could have a negative effect on our earnings.19 Business difficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.We currently have several customers that account for a substantial portion of our sales. In the mattress fabrics segment, several large bedding manufacturers have large market shares and comprise a significant portion of our mattress fabric sales. Although no mattress fabrics customers accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023, in many recent years we have had one or more customers who did. In the upholstery fabrics segment, La-Z-Boy Incorporated accounted for approximately 15% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2023, and several other large furniture manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales. A business failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of our major customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, could cause a significant loss in sales, an adverse effect on our earnings, and difficulty in collection of our trade accounts receivable. For example, on June 25, 2022, a major customer and its affiliates associated with our mattress fabrics segment announced that they filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, and on January 23, 2023, another major customer and its affiliates associated with our mattress fabrics segment filed pre-planned voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Although we did not record any credit losses and have received payment in full regarding all outstanding accounts receivable with respect to each of these customers, a business failure or loss of either such customer and its affiliates, or a business failure or loss of one or more other major customers, could cause a decrease in our sales and an adverse effect on our earnings. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, some customers experienced cash flow challenges and requested extended payment terms. During fiscal 2021, our customers returned to making payments based on normal credit terms, as opposed to the extended terms granted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, if the negative economic impact of COVID-19 reemerges, or if another pandemic, recession or other major unexpected economic event occurs, we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us or such payment may only occur after significant delay. While we perform credit evaluations of our customers, those evaluations may not prevent uncollectible trade accounts receivable. Credit evaluations involve significant management diligence and judgment, especially in the current environment. If more customers than we anticipate experience liquidity issues, if payments are not received on a timely basis, or if a customer declares bankruptcy, we may have difficulty collecting amounts owed to us by these customers, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity.If we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends, our sales and earnings may decline.Demand for various types of upholstery fabrics and mattress coverings changes over time due to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture and bedding. Our success in marketing our fabrics depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, incorrect projections about the demand for certain products could cause the accumulation of excess raw material or finished goods inventory, which could lead to inventory mark-downs and decreases in earnings.Increasing dependence on information technology systems comes with specific risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could have an adverse effect on our business.We increasingly rely on technology systems and infrastructure. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers in connection with the maintenance thereof and the execution of certain business processes. Greater dependence on technology systems heightens the risk of potential vulnerabilities from system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss, and other unforeseen events. Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons. With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, including internet selling, cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks. There is also the risk of our exposure to theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage, and a variety of cyber-attacks, including phishing attempts, covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks (or the computers and networks of our third-party providers), and impersonating authorized users, among other types of cyber-attacks, that could compromise our internal technology system, infrastructure, or result in data leakage in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become increasingly more sophisticated over time, and while we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effect. Failures of technology or related systems, cybersecurity incidents, or improper release of confidential information, could damage our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities, expenditures, and recovery time. Additionally, the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results. We continue to balance the risk of an electronic security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of confidential information with the cost to protect us against such a breach, and we have taken steps to ensure that losses arising from a breach would be covered in part by insurance that we carry, although the costs, potential monetary damages, and operational consequences of responding to cyber incidents and implementing remediation measures may be in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered at all by our insurance, and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers or our business reputation. We have been a target of cybersecurity 20 attacks in the past, and while such attacks have not resulted in a material impact on our operations, business, customer relationships, or reputation, such attacks could in the future.In addition, we permit certain employees to work from home from time to time. Although we continue to implement strong physical and cybersecurity measures to ensure that our business operations remain functional and to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers, our systems and our operations remain vulnerable to cyberattacks and other disruptions due to the fact that employees may be working remotely, and we cannot be certain that our mitigation efforts will be effective.We may not be able to recruit and retain key employees and skilled workers in a competitive labor market.If we cannot successfully recruit and retain key employees and skilled workers or if we experience the unexpected loss of those employees, our operations may be negatively affected. A shortage of qualified personnel, along with cost inflation, may require us to enhance our compensation in order to compete effectively in the hiring and retention of qualified employees.In addition, we are and will continue to be dependent upon our senior management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. COVID-19 may also increase the risk that certain senior management executives or a member of the board of directors could become ill, causing them to be incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended absence. Furthermore, because of the nature of the disease, multiple people working in proximity could also become ill simultaneously, which could result in the same department having extended absences. This could negatively affect the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and internal controls throughout the company.Our intellectual property rights may not prevent others from using our copyrights or trademarks in connection with the sale of competitive products. We may be subject to claims that our products or trademarks infringe intellectual property rights of others.We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, numerous trademarks and copyrights for various product and trade names, logos, and fabric designs in the United States and certain foreign countries.  We view such intellectual property, along with any unregistered copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, and proprietary technologies, as an important part of our business. These intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection against infringement or piracy, may not prevent competitors from developing and marketing products that are similar or competitive with our fabric designs or other products, and may be costly and time-consuming to protect and enforce. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent other companies from using our fabric designs or trademarks in connection with competitive products, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.We may be subject to claims that our products, advertising, or trademarks infringe the intellectual property rights of others. The defense of these claims, even if we are ultimately successful, may result in costly litigation, and if we are not successful in our defense, we could be subject to injunctions and liability for damages or royalty obligations, and our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions, which could involve certain risks and uncertainties.Acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. Acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges, such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities, properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters, ensuring adequate capital availability, and balancing other resource constraints. There are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions, including difficulties integrating acquired operations, technology, personnel, and financial and other systems; unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business; unrealized synergies and cost-savings; unknown or underestimated liabilities; diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses; and potential loss of key management employees of the acquired business. In addition, internal control over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Our integration activities may place substantial demand on our management, operational resources, and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service, or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Risks Related to Financing Our OperationsWe may require funding from external sources, which may not be available at the levels we require or may cost more than we expect. As a result, our expenses and operating results could be negatively affected.We regularly review and evaluate our liquidity and capital needs. Our available cash, cash equivalents, and cash flow from operations have been adequate to finance our operations and capital requirements in recent years. However, if we experience a sustained decline in 21 revenue, there may be periods in which we may require additional external funding to support our operations. Also, market interest rates have increased significantly since the beginning of fiscal 2023. If we have a need to incur debt under our credit facilities, the cost of borrowing could increase substantially over debt costs that we have previously incurred. As of April 30, 2023, we had approximately $32.6 million in combined total borrowing availability under our domestic credit facility and our China credit facility. In January of 2023, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with respect to our domestic credit facility, which provides for a revolving credit facility up to a maximum principal amount of $35.0 million, secured by a lien on the company's assets. The amount available under this facility is limited by a borrowing base consisting of certain eligible accounts receivable and inventory of the company. In the event we require additional liquidity from our lenders that exceeds the availability under our credit facilities at such time, such funds may not be available to us. In addition, in the event we draw on any of our credit facilities, outstanding amounts may become immediately due and payable upon certain events of default, including a failure to comply with the financial covenants or certain other affirmative and negative covenants in the credit agreements. If we are unable to access additional credit at the levels we require, or the cost of credit is greater than expected, it could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely affect our sales and earnings.We have been, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including environmental matters, product liability, and employment disputes, some of which claim significant damages. We face the continual business risk of exposure to claims that our operations have caused personal injury or property damage, including the related risk of damage to our brand and reputation in conjunction with such claims. We maintain insurance against product liability claims and, in some cases, have indemnification agreements with regard to environmental claims, but there can be no assurance that these arrangements will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such arrangements will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that claims against the company will not have a material adverse impact on our earnings or financial condition. We are also subject to various laws and regulations in our business, including those relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws or other regulations.We must comply with many governmental regulations applicable to our business, and changes in those regulations could adversely affect our business.Our products and raw materials are and will continue to be subject to regulation in the United States by various federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. In addition, other governments and agencies in other jurisdictions regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and raw materials. Also, rules and restrictions regarding the importation of fabrics and other materials, including custom duties, tariffs, import restrictions (including, without limitation, the recent enactment of the UFLPA), quotas, banned substances, and other regulations, are continually changing. Environmental laws, labor laws, tax laws and regulations (including, without limitation, the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax provisions), data privacy laws, and other regulations continually affect our business. These rules and regulations can and do change from time to time, which can increase our costs and our taxes, or can require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution. Changes in the rules and regulations applicable to our business may negatively affect our sales and earnings"
8,CULP,CULP INC,2022-07-15,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. In addition to the matters described above under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information,” set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause a material adverse change in our results of operations, financial condition, or future prospects. The risks described below should be carefully considered, together with other information provided in this report, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and our financial statements, including the related notes. The risks discussed below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in future periods.  Macroeconomic, Market, and Strategic RisksThe global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly and adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The global spread of COVID-19 has negatively affected the global and U.S. economy, severely disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, all of which have negatively affected, and continue to negatively affect, the bedding and home furnishings industries, our customers and suppliers, and our business. Many countries, including the countries in which we operate, as well as state and local governmental authorities, have taken various actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including mandated closures of businesses, stay-at-home orders, quarantine and isolation requirements, travel restrictions, border closings, restrictions on public gatherings, social distancing measures, occupancy limits, and other safety measures. While a number of these restrictions have been lifted as conditions have improved, they have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Due to government-mandated closure requirements near the end of March 2020, we shut down our facilities in Canada and Haiti for several weeks. At the same time, we experienced a rapid decline in demand as customers and retail stores began closing or substantially limiting their operations. We took a number of measures in response to the increasingly challenging market conditions, including, among other things, repurposing a portion of our available operations to produce face masks, bedding covers, and fabrics for healthcare operations and consumer health; reducing operating costs by implementing temporary salary reductions, making workforce adjustments to align with demand, suspending merit pay increases, and eliminating the cash compensation paid to our board of directors; aggressively reducing expenses, capital expenditures, and discretionary spending, and working with our vendors and landlords to negotiate temporary terms. We also took steps to safeguard the health of our employees, customers, and the communities we serve, including implementing detailed cleaning and disinfecting processes at our facilities, instituting temperature checks, adhering to social distancing and mask protocols, suspending non-essential travel, restricting visitors, providing remote work opportunities where possible, and offering on-site vaccination clinics to our employees, their families, and the general public. We have continued to monitor and update these procedures, in accordance with CDC recommendations and other local laws and regulatory authorities, throughout the pandemic.  While the COVID-19 pandemic continued to spread throughout the world during fiscal 2021, we did not experience additional closures of any of our operations, or any material closures of the operations of our suppliers, during the remainder of the fiscal year, following the initial shutdowns from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, during fiscal 2022, our upholstery fabrics business was materially affected by COVID-19 related shutdowns of our sourcing partners and customers in Vietnam throughout most of the second quarter, and our operations in China were shut down during the last month of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which prevented us from shipping goods in both our residential upholstery fabrics business and our sewn mattress cover business. In addition to these shutdowns, COVID-19 disruption affected our business during fiscal 2022, as well as the business of our customers and suppliers, due to employee absenteeism and labor shortages, pandemic-related effects on the availability and pricing of freight and raw material costs, and pandemic-related constraints on our customers’ capacity due to supply chain disruption for non-fabric components.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including additional surges in the number of cases, and any additional preventative or protective actions that governmental authorities or we may take in response to the pandemic, may continue to have an adverse effect on our business or the business of our customers, suppliers, or distribution channels, including additional business shutdowns, reduced operations, restrictions on shipping or installing products, reduced consumer demand, reduced availability and/or higher pricing of materials, or the ability of our customers to make payments. In addition, responding to the ongoing pandemic could divert management’s attention from our key strategic priorities, increase costs as we prioritize the health and safety of our employees and customers, cause us to reduce, delay, alter, or abandon strategic initiatives that may otherwise increase our long-term value, and otherwise continue to disrupt our business operations. Also, while we believe the employee safety measures we have implemented or others we may take in the future are temporary, they may continue until after the pandemic is contained and could amplify existing risks or introduce new risks that could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to, risks related to internal controls and cybersecurity, and risks relating to employee willingness to work. Furthermore, these safety measures may not be successful in preventing the spread of the virus among our employees, and we could face litigation or other claims related to unsafe working conditions, inadequate protection of our employees, or other similar or related claims. Any of these claims, even if without merit, could result in costly litigation or further divert management's attention and resources.16The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak; actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate the public health and economic effects; vaccine availability and effectiveness within the markets in which we operate; the impact on global supply chain conditions; employee absenteeism and labor shortages; and the short- and long-term disruption to the global economy, consumer confidence, demand for home furnishings products, unemployment, and the financial health of our customers, suppliers, and distribution channels. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business or on our future financial or operational results; however, the disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows over time. Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A – Risk Factors
, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  In addition, if in the future there is an outbreak of another highly infectious disease or other health concern or epidemic, we may be subject to similar risks as those currently posed by COVID-19.Continued economic and industry uncertainty could negatively affect our sales and earnings.Overall demand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding products, which is subject to cyclical variations in the general economy, including the current and evolving negative economic impact of rising fuel prices, inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Because purchases of furniture and bedding products may be considered discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products may be more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products. Economic downturns, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about future health and economic prospects can affect consumer spending habits and demand for discretionary items, including home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decline in our sales and earnings. In addition, the level of housing starts, sales of existing homes, trends in disposable income, changes in interest rates (particularly home mortgage rates), and availability of consumer credit, can also affect our business. While we saw an adverse impact from some of these measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic at the end of fiscal 2020 and the beginning of fiscal 2021, we experienced increased demand in our mattress fabrics segment and in the residential side of our upholstery fabrics segment for most of fiscal 2021, driven by greater consumer focus on the home environment and more discretionary spending being allocated to home furnishings in the face of travel restrictions and other pandemic-related factors. However, this trend began to reverse during fiscal 2022, particularly during the second half of the year, as COVID-related travel and mask restrictions were lifted and consumers began to resume travel and leisure activities. Inflationary pressures also began to affect consumer spending during the second half of fiscal 2022. We are unable to predict how long these trends will last, or to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic may affect the economic and purchasing cycle for home furnishing products (and therefore affect demand for our products) over the short and long term. Loss of market share due to competition would result in declines in sales and could result in losses or decreases in earnings.Our business is highly competitive and fragmented, and we face significant competition from many competitors, both foreign and domestic. We compete with many other manufacturers of fabric, as well as converters who source fabrics from various producers and market them to manufacturers of furniture and bedding. In many cases, these fabrics are sourced from foreign suppliers who have a lower cost structure than the company. The highly competitive nature of our business in each of our segments means we are constantly subject to the risk of losing market share, which would likely result in a loss or decrease our future sales and earnings. As a result of increased competition, there have been deflationary pressures on the prices for many of our products, which make it more difficult to pass along increased operating costs such as raw materials, shipping, energy, foreign currency fluctuations, or labor in the form of price increases, which puts downward pressure on our profit margins. Also, the wide range of product offerings in our business can make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design, styling, finish, and other techniques.Our operations are subject to risks of unsettled political conditions, civil unrest or instability, public health concerns or pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, acts of war, terrorism, and the effects of climate change, any one of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our domestic and foreign operations are subject to risks of unsettled political conditions, civil unrest or instability, public health concerns or pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, acts of war, and terrorism. In addition, the effects of climate change and actions taken to combat climate change could exacerbate these risks, including by increasing the likelihood and severity of extreme weather events. Any of these risks, including without limitation civil unrest in Haiti, could cause disruption at our manufacturing or distribution facilities, or at the facilities of our suppliers and distribution channels, which could make servicing our customers more difficult and could reduce our sales, earnings, or both in the future.Operational RisksOur business may be adversely affected by increased tariffs or other changes in U.S. policy related to imported products, as well as violations of existing trade policies.Many of our products are manufactured or sourced outside of the United States. The U.S. government has imposed certain tariffs on imports from various countries, including China, where a significant amount of our products is produced. In the future, the U.S. 17Government may consider imposing additional tariffs or extending the timeline for continuation of existing tariffs. Any tariffs that result in increased costs of imported products and materials could require us to increase prices to our domestic customers or, if we are unable to do so, result in lowering our gross margins on products sold. As a result, the tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition to tariffs, the U.S. government considers other proposals for substantial changes to its trade and tax policies, which could include import restrictions, increased import tariffs, changes to or withdrawal from existing trade agreements, and border-adjustment taxes, among other possible measures. Material changes in these policies could increase our tax obligations, require us to source materials from different regions, or increase prices to customers, which could adversely affect sales. Any significant change in U.S. policy related to imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.There are also a number of trade regulations and duties currently in place to protect the U.S. textile industry against competition from low-priced foreign producers, such as those in China and Vietnam, but violations of these trade regulations and duties has had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our operations. In May of 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed punitive anti-dumping measures against China mattress imports to address violations of trade regulations. Despite the imposition of these duties, if China producers move their production out of China, which we believe has already occurred, they may continue to engage in unfair competition in violation of trade regulations between the U.S. and other countries, or there may be a potential risk of illegal transshipments of mattress products into the United States, which involves circumventing the imposed duties by falsely claiming that mattresses are products of a particular country of origin to avoid paying higher duties. Also, if supply chains are moved out of China to countries without anti-dumping duties and producers continue to supply low-priced imports in violation of U.S. trade laws, and if illegal transshipments are not monitored and enforcement is not effective to limit them, these shipments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. During fiscal 2020, the U.S. mattress industry was affected by continued disruption relating to low-priced mattress imports that moved from China to other countries, which affected demand for our products. As a result, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed anti-dumping duties on mattress imports from seven of these countries during fiscal 2021. We believe the domestic mattress industry and, in turn, our business, began to realize some benefits from these duties during the second half of fiscal 2021 and continuing into fiscal 2022. However, despite the imposition of these duties, supply chains could move out of the affected countries to other countries without anti-dumping duties and continue supplying low-priced imports in violation of U.S. trade laws, or there may be a potential risk of illegal transshipments of mattress products from these countries to avoid paying the higher duties, which could negatively affect our business.  Greater reliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or raw materials increases the likelihood of disruptions to our supply chain or our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis.We rely significantly on operations in distant locations, especially China. In addition we have been purchasing a significant share of our products and raw materials from offshore sources, particularly Asia and Turkey. At the same time, our domestic manufacturing capacity for the upholstery fabrics segment continues to decline. These changes have caused us to rely on an extended supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do not control, both of which are inherently subject to greater risks of delay or disruption. In addition, operations and sourcing in foreign areas are subject to the risk of changing local governmental rules, taxes, changes in import rules or customs, tariffs, shipping rates, potential political unrest and instability, pandemic-related closure rules, or other threats that could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in foreign areas or sourcing products overseas. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies can affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United States. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies could make our products less competitive on the basis of price in markets outside the United States, and strengthening of currencies in Canada and China could have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those places. Any of the risks associated with foreign operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could have a negative impact on our ultimate financial results.Our business faces several risks associated with doing business in ChinaWe source a variety of fabrics from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we operate two upholstery manufacturing facilities and three warehouse facilities in Shanghai, China. The Chinese economy is characterized by extensive state ownership, control, and regulation. Therefore, our business is continually subject to the risk of changes in Chinese laws and regulations that could have an adverse effect on our suppliers and manufacturing operations. Any changes in policies governing tariffs, imports and exports, taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property, and financial regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, the Chinese legal system is continuing to develop and evolve, and the enforcement of rules and regulations is not always consistent or uniform. Moreover, any potential civil unrest, natural disasters, or other threats could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in China. The Chinese economy poses additional risks to our business, including fluctuating rates of inflation and currency exchange rates, a declining labor force participation rate, and rising employee wages. In addition, changes in the political climate or trade policy of the United States, such as increased duties, tariffs, or restrictions on Chinese imports, may adversely affect our business, and geo-political pressures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to introduce additional uncertainty, including with respect to tariffs and freight. Any of the risks associated with our Chinese 18operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively affect our ultimate financial results.We may have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements being used for products and services.We rely on outside sources for various products and services, including yarn and other raw materials, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics, and services such as weaving and finishing. Increased reliance on outsourcing lowers our capital investment and fixed costs, but it decreases the amount of control that we have over certain elements of our production capacity. Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw materials or other required products or services from our outside suppliers on a timely and cost-effective basis, especially if alternative suppliers cannot be immediately obtained, could disrupt our production and damage our financial results.Write-offs or write-downs of assets would result in a decrease in our earnings and shareholders’ equity. The company has long-lived assets, primarily consisting of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets.  ASC Topic 360 establishes an impairment accounting model for long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment and requires the company to assess for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered. Goodwill and other intangible assets must be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered.Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition, and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Any of such future actions could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and there is no assurance that future write-downs of fixed assets, goodwill, or other intangible assets will not occur if business conditions were to deteriorate.As a result of our impairment assessment conducted during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and our annual impairment assessment conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded asset impairment charges associated with our goodwill and tradenames totaling $33.9 million during the fiscal 2020 year. Of the total $33.9 million asset impairment charges, $27.2 million and $6.7 million pertained to goodwill and tradenames, respectively. Due to the asset impairment charge of $27.2 million associated with our goodwill, no goodwill was reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the end of fiscal 2020, 2021, or 2022. See notes 8 and 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our assessments of impairment, conclusions reached, and the performance of our quantitative tests.Changes in the price, availability, and quality of raw materials could increase our costs or cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would result in decreased earnings.We depend upon outside suppliers for most of our raw material needs, and we rely upon outside suppliers for component materials such as yarn and unfinished fabrics, as well as for certain services such as finishing and weaving. Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of these goods and services have had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on our production costs and ability to meet the demands of our customers, which can affect our ability to generate sales and earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass through increased costs of raw materials or increased production costs to our customers through price increases. In particular, many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our material costs are especially sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. Increases in prices for oil, petrochemical products or other raw materials and services provided by outside suppliers can significantly increase our costs and negatively affect our profit margins and earnings. During fiscal 2021, our raw material costs were mostly flat or slightly lower during the first three quarters of the year, but prices began to escalate during the fourth quarter primarily due to rising oil prices, a higher demand environment, and labor shortages. These pressures continued during fiscal 2022, with further increases in raw material costs, particularly during the second half of the year, due to the continued rise in oil prices and a higher demand environment. These pressures may continue to drive additional increases in raw material prices in the future. Increases in energy costs increase our operating costs and could adversely affect earnings.Higher prices for electricity, natural gas, and fuel increase our production and shipping costs. A significant shortage, increased prices, or interruptions in the availability of these energy sources would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers and would be likely to adversely affect our earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass along the full extent of increases in our production costs to customers through price increases. Energy costs have varied significantly during recent fiscal years and remain a volatile element of our costs. Increases in energy costs could have a negative effect on our earnings.Business difficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.We currently have several customers that account for a substantial portion of our sales. In the mattress fabrics segment, several large bedding manufacturers have large market shares and comprise a significant portion of our mattress fabric sales, with Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC accounting for approximately 11% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022. These include sales to customers who are 19also subcontractors for Serta Simmons Holding, LLC. In the upholstery fabrics segment, La-Z-Boy Incorporated accounted for approximately 13% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2022, and several other large furniture manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales. A business failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of our major customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, could cause a significant loss in sales, an adverse effect on our earnings, and difficulty in collection of our trade accounts receivable. For example, on June 25, 2022, a major customer and its affiliates associated with our mattress fabrics segment announced that they filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. See Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements for further details regarding this filing and its potential impact on our trade accounts receivable. Based on the information available to us at this time, we expect that this customer and its affiliates will continue to conduct normal business operations pending the reorganization, but a business failure or loss of this customer and its affiliates could cause a decrease in our sales and an adverse effect on our earnings.  Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, some customers experienced cash flow challenges and requested extended payment terms. During fiscal 2021, our customers returned to making payments based on normal credit terms, as opposed to the extended terms granted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, if the negative economic impact of COVID-19 reemerges, or if another pandemic, recession or other major unexpected economic event occurs, we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us or such payment may only occur after significant delay. While we perform credit evaluations of our customers, those evaluations may not prevent uncollectible trade accounts receivable. Credit evaluations involve significant management diligence and judgment, especially in the current environment. If more customers than we anticipate experience liquidity issues, if payments are not received on a timely basis, or if a customer declares bankruptcy, we may have difficulty collecting amounts owed to us by these customers, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity.If we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends, our sales and earnings may decline.Demand for various types of upholstery fabrics and mattress coverings changes over time due to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture and bedding. Our success in marketing our fabrics depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, incorrect projections about the demand for certain products could cause the accumulation of excess raw material or finished goods inventory, which could lead to inventory mark-downs and decreases in earnings.Increasing dependence on information technology systems comes with specific risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could have an adverse effect on our business.We increasingly rely on technology systems and infrastructure. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers in connection with the maintenance thereof and the execution of certain business processes. Greater dependence on technology systems heightens the risk of potential vulnerabilities from system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss, and other unforeseen events. Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons. With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, including internet selling, cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks. There is also the risk of our exposure to theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage, and a variety of cyber-attacks, including phishing attempts, covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks (or the computers and networks of our third-party providers), and impersonating authorized users, among other types of cyber-attacks, that could compromise our internal technology system, infrastructure, or result in data leakage in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become increasingly more sophisticated over time, and while we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effect. Failures of technology or related systems, cybersecurity incidents, or improper release of confidential information, could damage our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities, expenditures, and recovery time. Additionally, the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results. We continue to balance the risk of an electronic security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of confidential information with the cost to protect us against such a breach, and we have taken steps to ensure that losses arising from a breach would be covered in part by insurance that we carry, although the costs, potential monetary damages, and operational consequences of responding to cyber incidents and implementing remediation measures may be in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered at all by our insurance, and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers or our business reputation. We have been a target of cybersecurity attacks in the past, and while such attacks have not resulted in a material impact on our operations, business, customer relationships, or reputation, such attacks could in the future.In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have permitted certain employees to work from home from time to time. Although we continue to implement strong physical and cybersecurity measures to ensure that our business operations remain functional and to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers, our systems and our operations remain vulnerable to cyberattacks and other disruptions due to the fact that more employees may be working remotely, and we cannot be certain that our mitigation efforts will be effective.20We may not be able to recruit and retain key employees and skilled workers in a competitive labor market.If we cannot successfully recruit and retain key employees and skilled workers or if we experience the unexpected loss of those employees, our operations may be negatively affected. A shortage of qualified personnel, along with cost inflation, may require us to enhance our compensation in order to compete effectively in the hiring and retention of qualified employees.In addition, we are and will continue to be dependent upon our senior management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. COVID-19 may also increase the risk that certain senior management executives or a member of the board of directors could become ill, causing them to be incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended absence. Furthermore, because of the nature of the disease, multiple people working in proximity could also become ill simultaneously, which could result in the same department having extended absences. This could negatively affect the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and internal controls throughout the company.Where possible, we have permitted work-from-home arrangements for certain employees in order to limit the number of people at our facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of stay-at-home orders and our work-from-home policies may negatively affect productivity and disrupt our business, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course.Our intellectual property rights may not prevent others from using our copyrights or trademarks in connection with the sale of competitive products. We may be subject to claims that our products or trademarks infringe intellectual property rights of others.We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, numerous trademarks and copyrights for various product and trade names, logos, and fabric designs in the United States and certain foreign countries.  We view such intellectual property, along with any unregistered copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, and proprietary technologies, as an important part of our business. These intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection against infringement or piracy, may not prevent competitors from developing and marketing products that are similar or competitive with our fabric designs or other products, and may be costly and time-consuming to protect and enforce. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent other companies from using our fabric designs or trademarks in connection with competitive products, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.We may be subject to claims that our products, advertising, or trademarks infringe the intellectual property rights of others. The defense of these claims, even if we are ultimately successful, may result in costly litigation, and if we are not successful in our defense, we could be subject to injunctions and liability for damages or royalty obligations, and our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions, which could involve certain risks and uncertainties.Acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. Acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges, such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities, properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters, ensuring adequate capital availability, and balancing other resource constraints. There are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions, including difficulties integrating acquired operations, technology, personnel, and financial and other systems; unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business; unrealized synergies and cost-savings; unknown or underestimated liabilities; diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses; and potential loss of key management employees of the acquired business. In addition, internal control over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Our integration activities may place substantial demand on our management, operational resources, and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service, or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Risks Related to Financing Our OperationsWe may require funding from external sources, which may not be available at the levels we require or may cost more than we expect. As a result, our expenses and operating results could be negatively affected.We regularly review and evaluate our liquidity and capital needs. Our available cash, cash equivalents, and cash flow from operations have been adequate to finance our operations and capital requirements in recent years. However, if we experience a sustained decline in revenue, there may be periods in which we may require additional external funding to support our operations.As of May 1, 2022, we had approximately $38 million in combined total borrowing availability under our domestic credit facility and our China credit facility. In June of 2022, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with respect to our domestic 21credit facility, which provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $40 million, secured by a lien on the company’s assets, where the borrowing availability is determined based on certain eligible accounts receivable and inventory of the company. In the event we require additional liquidity from our lenders that exceeds the availability under our credit facilities at such time, such funds may not be available to us. In addition, in the event we draw on any of our credit facilities, outstanding amounts may become immediately due and payable upon certain events of default, including a failure to comply with the financial covenants or certain other affirmative and negative covenants in the credit agreements. If we are unable to access additional credit at the levels we require, or the cost of credit is greater than expected, it could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely affect our sales and earnings.We have been, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including environmental matters, product liability, and employment disputes, some of which claim significant damages. We face the continual business risk of exposure to claims that our operations have caused personal injury or property damage, including the related risk of damage to our brand and reputation in conjunction with such claims. We maintain insurance against product liability claims and, in some cases, have indemnification agreements with regard to environmental claims, but there can be no assurance that these arrangements will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such arrangements will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that claims against the company will not have a material adverse impact on our earnings or financial condition. We are also subject to various laws and regulations in our business, including those relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws or other regulations.We must comply with many governmental regulations applicable to our business, and changes in those regulations could adversely affect our business.Our products and raw materials are and will continue to be subject to regulation in the United States by various federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. In addition, other governments and agencies in other jurisdictions regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and raw materials. Also, rules and restrictions regarding the importation of fabrics and other materials, including custom duties, tariffs, quotas, banned substances, and other regulations, are continually changing. Environmental laws, labor laws, tax laws and regulations (including, without limitation, the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax provisions), data privacy laws, and other regulations continually affect our business. These rules and regulations can and do change from time to time, which can increase our costs and our taxes, or can require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution. Changes in the rules and regulations applicable to our business may negatively affect our sales and earnings"
0,CULP,CULP INC,2021-07-16,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSOur business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties. In addition to the matters described above under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information,” set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause a material adverse change in our results of operations or financial condition. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. Macroeconomic, Market, and Strategic RisksThe global COVID-19 pandemic has significantly and adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.The global spread of COVID-19 has negatively affected the global and U.S. economy, severely disrupted global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, all of which have negatively affected, and continue to negatively affect, the bedding and home furnishings industries, our customers and suppliers, and our business. Many countries, including the countries in which we operate, as well as state and local governmental authorities, have taken various actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border closings, stay-at-home orders, quarantine and isolation requirements, restrictions on public gatherings, social distancing measures, mandated closures of non-essential businesses, occupancy limits, and other safety measures. While a number of these restrictions have been lifted as conditions have improved, they have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Due to government-mandated closure requirements near the end of March 2020, we shut down our facilities in Canada and Haiti for several weeks. At the same time, we experienced a rapid decline in demand as customers and retail stores began closing or substantially limiting their operations. We took a number of measures in response to the increasingly challenging market conditions, including, among other things, repurposing a portion of our available operations to produce face masks, bedding covers, and fabrics for healthcare operations and consumer health; reducing operating costs by implementing temporary salary reductions, making workforce adjustments to align with demand, suspending merit pay increases, and eliminating the cash compensation paid to our board of directors; aggressively reducing expenses, capital expenditures, and discretionary spending, and working with our vendors and landlords to negotiate temporary terms. We also took steps to safeguard the health of our employees, customers, and the communities we serve, including implementing detailed cleaning and disinfecting processes at our facilities, instituting temperature checks, adhering to social distancing and mask protocols, suspending non-essential travel, restricting visitors, providing remote work opportunities where possible, and offering on-site vaccination clinics to our employees, their families, and the general public. We have continued to monitor and update these procedures, in accordance with CDC recommendations and other local laws and regulatory authorities, throughout the pandemic.  The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including localized increases or additional surges in the number of cases, and any additional preventative or protective actions that governmental authorities or we may take in response to the pandemic, may continue to have an adverse effect on our business or the business of our customers, suppliers, or distribution channels, including additional business shutdowns, reduced operations, restrictions on shipping or installing products, reduced consumer demand, reduced availability and/or higher pricing of materials, or the ability of our customers to make payments. In addition, responding to the ongoing pandemic could divert management’s attention from our key strategic priorities, increase costs as we prioritize the health and safety of our employees and customers, cause us to reduce, delay, alter, or abandon strategic initiatives that may otherwise increase our long-term value, and otherwise continue to disrupt our business operations. Also, while we believe the employee-safety measures we have implemented or others we may take in the future are temporary, they may continue until after the pandemic is contained and could amplify existing risks or introduce new risks that could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to, risks related to internal controls and cybersecurity, risks relating to employee willingness to work. Furthermore, these safety measures may not be successful in preventing the spread of the virus among our employees and we could face litigation or other claims related to unsafe working conditions, inadequate protection of our employees, or other similar or related claims. Any of these claims, even if without merit, could result in costly litigation or further divert management's attention and resources.The ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly and depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak, actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate the public health and economic effects, vaccine availability, adoption, and effectiveness within the markets in which we operate, global supply chain conditions, and the short- and long-term disruption to the global economy, consumer confidence, demand for home furnishings products, unemployment, and the financial health of our customers, suppliers, and distribution channels. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business or on our future financial or operational results; however, the disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows over time. Furthermore, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A – Risk Factors
, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  16 In addition, if in the future there is an outbreak of another highly infectious disease or other health concern or epidemic, we may be subject to similar risks as those currently posed by COVID-19.Continued economic and industry uncertainty could negatively affect our sales and earnings.Overall demand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding products, which is subject to variations in the general economy, including the current and evolving negative economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Because purchases of furniture and bedding products are discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products may be more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products. Economic downturns, increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about future health and economic prospects can affect consumer spending habits and demand for home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decline in our sales and earnings. In addition, the level of housing starts, sales of existing homes, trends in disposable income, changes in interest rates (particularly home mortgage rates), and availability of consumer credit, can also affect our business. While we have seen an adverse impact on some of these measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced increased demand in our mattress fabrics segment and in the residential side of our upholstery fabrics segment beginning at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by greater consumer focus on the home environment and more discretionary spending being allocated to home furnishings in the face of travel restrictions and other pandemic-related factors. However, we are unable to predict how long this trend will last or to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic may impact the economic and purchasing cycle for home furnishing products (and therefore affect demand for our products) over the short and long term. Loss of market share due to competition would result in declines in sales and could result in losses or decreases in earnings.Our business is highly competitive and fragmented, and we face significant competition from many competitors, both foreign and domestic. We compete with many other manufacturers of fabric, as well as converters who source fabrics from various producers and market them to manufacturers of furniture and bedding. In many cases, these fabrics are sourced from foreign suppliers who have a lower cost structure than the company. The highly competitive nature of our business in each of our segments means we are constantly subject to the risk of losing market share, which would likely result in a loss or decrease our future sales and earnings. As a result of increased competition, there have been deflationary pressures on the prices for many of our products, which make it more difficult to pass along increased operating costs such as raw materials, shipping, energy, foreign currency fluctuations, or labor in the form of price increases and puts downward pressure on our profit margins. Also, the wide range of product offerings in our business can make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design, styling, finish, and other techniques.Our operations are subject to risks of unsettled political conditions, civil unrest or instability, public health concerns or pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, acts of war, and terrorism, any one of which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our domestic and foreign operations are subject to risks of unsettled political conditions, civil unrest or instability, public health concerns or pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, acts of war, and terrorism. Any of these risks, including without limitation the recent assassination of Haiti’s president and resulting civil unrest, could cause disruption at our manufacturing or distribution facilities, or at the facilities of our suppliers and distribution channels, which could make servicing our customers more difficult and could reduce our sales, earnings, or both in the future.Operational RisksOur business may be adversely affected by increased tariffs or other changes in U.S. policy related to imported products, as well as violations of existing trade policies.Many of our products are manufactured or sourced outside of the United States. The U.S. government has compiled a list of products under consideration for potential tariffs on imports from many countries, including China, where a significant amount of our products are produced. Certain tariffs have been imposed, and consideration is ongoing regarding possible additional tariffs and other categories of products subject to the already-imposed tariffs. Any tariffs that result in increased costs of imported products and materials could require us to increase prices to our domestic customers or, if we are unable to do so, result in lowering our gross margins on products sold. As a result, the tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition to tariffs, the U.S. government considers other proposals for substantial changes to its trade and tax policies, which could include import restrictions, increased import tariffs, changes to or withdrawal from existing trade agreements, and border-adjustment taxes, among other possible measures. Material changes in these policies could increase our tax obligations or require us to increase prices to customers, which could adversely affect sales. Any significant change in U.S. policy related to imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.There are also a number of trade regulations and duties currently in place to protect the U.S. textile industry against competition from low-priced foreign producers, such as those in China and Vietnam, but violations of these trade regulations and duties has had, and may 17 in the future have, a material adverse effect on our operations. In May of 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed punitive anti-dumping measures against China mattress imports to address violations of trade regulations. Despite the imposition of these duties, if China producers move their production out of China, which we believe has already started to occur, they may continue to engage in unfair competition in violation of trade regulations between the U.S. and other countries, or there may be a potential risk of illegal transshipments of mattress products into the United States, which involves circumventing the imposed duties by falsely claiming that mattresses are products of a particular country of origin to avoid paying higher duties. Also, if supply chains are moved out of China to countries without anti-dumping duties and producers continue to supply low-priced imports in violation of U.S. trade laws, and if illegal transshipments are not monitored and enforcement is not effective to limit them, these shipments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. During fiscal 2020, the U.S. mattress industry was affected by continued disruption relating to low-priced mattress imports that moved from China to other countries, which affected demand for our products. As a result, anti-dumping duty petitions were filed with the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) and U.S. Department of Commerce in March of 2020 against seven of these countries for engaging in unfair trade practices relating to low-priced mattress imports, and in May of 2020, the ITC reached a preliminary determination allowing these petitions to move forward. In October of 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed preliminary anti-dumping duties on mattress imports from these countries. We believe the domestic mattress industry and, in turn, our business, began to realize some benefits from these duties during the second half of fiscal 2021. However, despite the imposition of these duties, supply chains could move out of the affected countries to other countries without anti-dumping duties and continue supplying low-priced imports in violation of U.S. trade laws, or there may be a potential risk of illegal transshipments of mattress products from these countries to avoid paying the higher duties, which could negatively affect the company’s business.  Greater reliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or raw materials increases the likelihood of disruptions to our supply chain or our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis.We rely significantly on operations in distant locations, especially China, and in addition we have been purchasing a significant share of our products and raw materials from offshore sources, particularly Asia and Turkey. At the same time, with the closure of our Anderson, South Carolina plant during the first half of fiscal 2019, our domestic manufacturing capacity for the upholstery fabrics segment continues to decline. These changes have caused us to rely on an extended supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do not control, both of which are inherently subject to greater risks of delay or disruption. In addition, operations and sourcing in foreign areas are subject to the risk of changing local governmental rules, taxes, changes in import rules or customs, tariffs, shipping rates, potential political unrest and instability, or other threats that could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in foreign areas or sourcing products overseas. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies can affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United States. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies can have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those countries. Any of the risks associated with foreign operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results.Our business faces several risks associated with doing business in ChinaWe source a variety of fabrics from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we operate two upholstery manufacturing facilities and three warehouse facilities in Shanghai, China. The Chinese economy is characterized by extensive state ownership, control, and regulation. Therefore, our business is continually subject to the risk of changes in Chinese laws and regulations that could have an adverse effect on our suppliers and manufacturing operations. Any changes in policies governing tariffs, imports and exports, taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property, and financial regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, the Chinese legal system is continuing to develop and evolve, and the enforcement of rules and regulations is not always consistent or uniform. Moreover, any potential civil unrest, natural disasters, or other threats could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in China. The Chinese economy poses additional risks to our business, including fluctuating rates of inflation and currency exchange rates, a declining labor force participation rate, and rising employee wages. In addition, changes in the political climate or trade policy of the United States, such as increased duties or tariffs on Chinese imports, may adversely affect our business, and geo-political pressures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to introduce additional uncertainty, including with respect to tariffs and freight. Any of the risks associated with our Chinese operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively affect our ultimate financial results.We may have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements being used for products and services.We rely on outside sources for various products and services, including yarn and other raw materials, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics, and services such as weaving and finishing. Increased reliance on outsourcing lowers our capital investment and fixed costs, but it decreases the amount of control that we have over certain elements of our production capacity. Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw materials or other required products or services from our outside suppliers on a timely and cost-effective basis, especially if alternative suppliers cannot be immediately obtained, could disrupt our production and damage our financial results.18 Write-offs or write-downs of assets would result in a decrease in our earnings and shareholders’ equity. The company has long-lived assets, primarily consisting of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets.  ASC Topic 360 establishes an impairment accounting model for long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment and requires the company to assess for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered.  ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered.Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results, competition, and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Any of such future actions could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and there is no assurance that future write-downs of fixed assets, goodwill, or other intangible assets will not occur if business conditions were to deteriorate.As a result of our impairment assessment conducted during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 and our annual impairment assessment conducted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we recorded asset impairment charges associated with our goodwill and tradenames totaling $33.9 million during the fiscal 2020 year. Of the total $33.9 million asset impairment charges, $27.2 million and $6.7 million pertained to goodwill and tradenames, respectively. Due to the asset impairment charge of $27.2 million associated with our goodwill, no goodwill was reported on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of May 2, 2021, and May 3, 2020. See notes 8 and 9 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our assessments of impairment, conclusions reached, and the performance of our quantitative tests.During fiscal 2019, we closed our Anderson, South Carolina upholstery fabrics facility due to the continued decline in demand for the products manufactured at this facility, reflecting change in consumer style preferences. As a result of this plant closure, were recorded inventory markdowns totaling $1.6 million, which were mostly offset by a gain on the sale of property, plant, and equipment of $1.5 million.Changes in the price, availability, and quality of raw materials could increase our costs or cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would result in decreased earnings.We depend upon outside suppliers for most of our raw material needs, and we rely upon outside suppliers for component materials such as yarn and unfinished fabrics, as well as for certain services such as finishing and weaving. Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of these goods and services could have a negative effect on our production costs and ability to meet the demands of our customers, which would affect our ability to generate sales and earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass through increased costs of raw materials or increased production costs to our customers through price increases. In particular, many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our material costs are especially sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. Increases in prices for oil, petrochemical products or other raw materials and services provided by outside suppliers can significantly increase our costs and negatively affect earnings. Although our raw material costs were flat or slightly lower during the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, prices began to escalate during the fourth quarter primarily due to rising oil prices, a higher demand environment, and labor shortages. We expect these pressures will continue in the short term, resulting in higher raw material costs during fiscal 2022, but prices may gradually flatten as market conditions normalize. Higher raw material prices result in downward pressure on our profit margins and earnings.Increases in energy costs would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect earnings.Higher prices for electricity, natural gas, and fuel increase our production and shipping costs. A significant shortage, increased prices, or interruptions in the availability of these energy sources would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers and would be likely to adversely affect our earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass along the full extent of increases in our production costs to customers through price increases. Energy costs have varied significantly during recent fiscal years and remain a volatile element of our costs. Increases in energy costs could have a negative effect on our earnings.Business difficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings.We currently have several customers that account for a substantial portion of our sales. In the mattress fabrics segment, several large bedding manufacturers have large market shares and comprise a significant portion of our mattress fabric sales, with Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC accounting for approximately 10% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021. These include sales to customers who are also subcontractors for Serta Simmons Holding, LLC. In the upholstery fabrics segment, La-Z-Boy Incorporated accounted for approximately 13% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2021, and several other large furniture manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales. A business failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of our major customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, could cause a significant loss in sales, an adverse effect on our earnings, and difficulty in collection of our trade accounts receivable.19 Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, some customers experienced cash flow challenges and requested extended payment terms. During fiscal 2021, our customers returned to making payments based on normal credit terms, as opposed to the extended terms granted during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. However, if the negative economic impact of COVID-19 reemerges or if a similar pandemic or another major, unexpected event with negative economic effects occurs, we may not be able to collect amounts owed to us or such payment may only occur after significant delay. While we perform credit evaluations of our customers, those evaluations may not prevent uncollectible trade accounts receivable. Credit evaluations involve significant management diligence and judgment, especially in the current environment. If more customers than we anticipate experience liquidity issues, if payments are not received on a timely basis, or if a customer declares bankruptcy, we may have difficulty collecting amounts owed to us by these customers, which could adversely affect our sales, earnings, financial condition, and liquidity.If we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends, our sales and earnings may decline.Demand for various types of upholstery fabrics and mattress coverings changes over time due to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture and bedding. Our success in marketing our fabrics depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, incorrect projections about the demand for certain products could cause the accumulation of excess raw material or finished goods inventory, which could lead to inventory mark-downs and decreases in earnings.Increasing dependence on information technology systems comes with specific risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could have an adverse effect on our business.We increasingly rely on technology systems and infrastructure. Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers in connection with the maintenance thereof and the execution of certain business processes. Greater dependence on technology systems heightens the risk of potential vulnerabilities from system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss, and other unforeseen events. Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons. With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, including internet selling, cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks. There is also the risk of our exposure to theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage, and a variety of cyber-attacks, including phishing attempts, covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks (or the computers and networks of our third-party providers), and impersonating authorized users, among other types of cyber-attacks, that could compromise our internal technology system, infrastructure, or result in data leakage in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems have become increasingly more sophisticated over time, and while we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, in some cases we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effect. Failures of technology or related systems, cybersecurity incidents, or improper release of confidential information, could damage our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities, expenditures, and recovery time. Additionally, the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology systems in the future could significantly increase our operating costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results. We continue to balance the risk of an electronic security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of confidential information with the cost to protect us against such a breach, and we have taken steps to ensure that losses arising from a breach would be covered in part by insurance that we carry, although the costs, potential monetary damages, and operational consequences of responding to cyber incidents and implementing remediation measures may be in excess of our insurance coverage or not covered at all by our insurance, and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results to the extent losses are uninsured or exceed insurance recoveries and to the extent that such disruptions adversely impact our relationships with our customers. We have been a target of cybersecurity attacks in the past, and while such attacks have not resulted in a material impact on our operations, business, or customer relationships, such attacks could in the future.In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have permitted certain employees to work from home in order to limit the number of people at our facilities. Although we continue to implement strong physical and cybersecurity measures to ensure that our business operations remain functional and to ensure uninterrupted service to our customers, our systems and our operations remain vulnerable to cyberattacks and other disruptions due to the fact that more employees are working remotely, and we cannot be certain that our mitigation efforts will be effective.We may not be able to recruit and retain key employees and skilled workers in a competitive labor market.If we cannot successfully recruit and retain key employees and skilled workers or if we experience the unexpected loss of those employees, our operations may be negatively affected. A shortage of qualified personnel may require us to enhance our compensation in order to compete effectively in the hiring and retention of qualified employees.In addition, we are and will continue to be dependent upon our senior management team and other key personnel. Losing the services of one or more key members of our management team or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. COVID-19 may also 20 increase the risk that certain senior management executives or a member of the board of directors could become ill, causing them to be incapacitated or otherwise unable to perform their duties for an extended absence. Furthermore, because of the nature of the disease, multiple people working in proximity could also become ill simultaneously, which could result in the same department having extended absences. This could negatively affect the efficiency and effectiveness of processes and internal controls throughout the company.Where possible, we have permitted work-from-home arrangements for certain employees in order to limit the number of people at our facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The effects of stay-at-home orders and our work-from-home policies may negatively affect productivity and disrupt our business, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course.Our intellectual property rights may not prevent others from using our copyrights or trademarks in connection with the sale of competitive products. We may be subject to claims that our products or trademarks infringe intellectual property rights of others.We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, numerous trademarks and copyrights for various product and trade names, logos, and fabric designs in the United States and certain foreign countries.  We view such intellectual property, along with any unregistered copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, and proprietary technologies, as an important part of our business. These intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection against infringement or piracy, may not prevent competitors from developing and marketing products that are similar or competitive with our fabric designs or other products, and may be costly and time-consuming to protect and enforce. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent other companies from using our fabric designs or trademarks in connection with competitive products, which could adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition.We may be subject to claims that our products, advertising, or trademarks infringe the intellectual property rights of others. The defense of these claims, even if we are ultimately successful, may result in costly litigation, and if we are not successful in our defense, we could be subject to injunctions and liability for damages or royalty obligations, and our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions, which could involve certain risks and uncertainties.Acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. Acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges, such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities, properly evaluating risks and other diligence matters, ensuring adequate capital availability, and balancing other resource constraints. There are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions, including difficulties integrating acquired operations, technology, personnel, and financial and other systems; unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business; unrealized synergies and cost-savings; unknown or underestimated liabilities; diversion of management attention from running our existing businesses; and potential loss of key management employees of the acquired business. In addition, internal control over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Our integration activities may place substantial demand on our management, operational resources, and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service, or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.Risks Related to Financing Our OperationsWe may require funding from external sources, which may not be available at the levels we require or may cost more than we expect. As a result, our expenses and operating results could be negatively affected.We regularly review and evaluate our liquidity and capital needs. In March 2020, in order to increase balance sheet flexibility during the COVID-19 crisis, we proactively drew down $29.8 million under our $30 million domestic revolving credit facility, as well as an additional $1 million under our $6 million China credit facility. We subsequently repaid these borrowings in full in June of 2020 based on improving business conditions. We believe our available cash, cash equivalents, and cash flow from operations will be enough to finance our operations and expected capital requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, if we experience a sustained decline in revenue relating to the COVID-19 pandemic or other event, there may be periods in which we may require additional external funding to support our operations.As of May 2, 2021, we had approximately $38 million in combined total borrowing availability under our domestic credit facility and our China credit facility. In the event we require additional liquidity from our lenders that exceeds the availability under our credit facilities at such time, such funds may not be available to us. In addition, outstanding amounts under the credit facility may become immediately due and payable upon certain events of default, including a failure to comply with the financial covenants or certain other 21 affirmative and negative covenants in the credit agreements. If we are unable to access additional credit at the levels we require, or the cost of credit is greater than expected, it could adversely affect our operating results or financial condition.Changes in the method of determining the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates.On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. Our domestic revolving credit facility, which expires August 15, 2022, uses LIBOR as the benchmark for setting the interest rate thereunder. In March of 2020, we amended this credit facility to, among other things, address a phase out of LIBOR by providing for an alternative benchmark. We cannot predict the effect of the use of this alternative benchmark, but our interest expense could increase and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely affect our sales and earnings.We have been, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including environmental matters, product liability, and employment disputes, some of which claim significant damages.  We face the continual business risk of exposure to claims that our operations have caused personal injury or property damage, including the related risk of damage to our brand and reputation in conjunction with such claims.  We maintain insurance against product liability claims and in some cases have indemnification agreements with regard to environmental claims, but there can be no assurance that these arrangements will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such arrangements will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred.  Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that claims against the company will not have a material adverse impact on our earnings or financial condition.  We are also subject to various laws and regulations in our business, including those relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment.  We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws or other regulations.We must comply with many governmental regulations applicable to our business, and changes in those regulations could adversely affect our business.Our products and raw materials are and will continue to be subject to regulation in the United States by various federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. In addition, other governments and agencies in other jurisdictions regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and raw materials. Also, rules and restrictions regarding the importation of fabrics and other materials, including custom duties, tariffs, quotas, and other regulations, are continually changing. Environmental laws, labor laws, tax laws and regulations (including, without limitation, the Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) tax provisions), data privacy laws, and other regulations continually affect our business. These rules and regulations can and do change from time to time, which can increase our costs and our taxes, or can require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution. Changes in the rules and regulations applicable to our business may negatively affect our sales and earnings"
13,CULP,CULP INC,2019-07-12,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS     Our business is subject to risks and uncertainties.  In addition to the matters described above under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information,” set forth      below are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause a material adverse change in our results of operations or financial condition.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently      known to us or not presently deemed material by us also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. Continued economic uncertainty could negatively affect our sales and earnings. Overall demand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture, bedding, and bedding accessory products, which is subject to variations in the general economy.       Because purchases of furniture, bedding and bedding accessory products are discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products is sometimes more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products.       Economic downturns and uncertainty can affect consumer spending habits and demand for home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decrease in our sales and earnings.  Economic uncertainty has caused a      decrease in consumer spending and demand for home furnishings, including goods that incorporate our products.  If these conditions persist, our business will be negatively affected. Our business may be adversely affected by increased tariffs or other changes in U.S. policy related to imported products, as well as violations of        existing trade policies.Many of our products are manufactured or sourced outside of the United States.  The U.S. government has recently compiled a list of products under consideration for        potential tariffs on imports from many countries, including China, where a significant amount of our products is produced. Certain tariffs have been imposed, and negotiations continue regarding possible additional tariffs and additional categories        of products subject to the already-imposed tariffs. Any tariffs that result in increased costs of imported products and materials could require us to increase prices to our domestic customers or, if we are unable to do so, result in lowering our        gross margins on products sold. As a result, the tariffs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.In addition to recent announcements about tariffs, the U.S. government is considering other proposals for substantial changes to its trade and tax policies, which could        include import restrictions, increased import tariffs, changes to or withdrawal from existing trade agreements, and border-adjustment taxes, among other possible measures. Material changes in these policies could increase our tax obligations or        require us to increase prices to customers, which could adversely affect sales. Any significant change in U.S. policy related to imported products could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.22Finally, there are currently a number of trade regulations and duties in place to protect the U.S. textile industry against competition from low-priced foreign producers,        such as those in China and Vietnam, but violations of these trade regulations and duties has had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our operations. In May of 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce imposed punitive anti-dumping        measures against China mattress imports to address violations of trade regulations. Despite the imposition of these duties, if China producers move their production out of China, they may continue to engage in unfair competition in violation of        trade regulations between the U.S. and other countries, or there may be a potential risk of illegal transshipments of mattress products into the United States, which involves circumventing the imposed duties by falsely claiming that mattresses are        products of a particular country of origin to avoid paying higher duties. If supply chains are moved out of China to countries without anti-dumping duties and producers continue to supply low-priced imports in violation of U.S. trade laws, and if        illegal transshipments are not monitored and enforcement is not effective to limit them, these shipments could have a material adverse effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.         Greater reliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or raw materials increases the likelihood of disruptions to our supply chain or our      ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. We rely significantly on operations in distant locations, especially China, and in addition we have been purchasing a significant share of our products and raw materials from      offshore sources, particularly Asia and Turkey.  At the same time, with the closure of our Anderson, South Carolina plant during the first half of fiscal 2019, our domestic manufacturing capacity for the upholstery fabrics segment continues to      decline.  These changes have caused us to rely on a much longer supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do not control, both of which are inherently subject to greater risks of delay or disruption.  In addition, operations and      sourcing in foreign areas are subject to the risk of changing local governmental rules, taxes, changes in import rules or customs, tariffs, shipping rates, potential political unrest and instability, or other threats that could disrupt or increase      the costs of operating in foreign areas or sourcing products overseas.  Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies can affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United      States.  Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies can have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those countries.  Any of the risks associated with foreign operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases      in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results.23Our business faces several risks associated with doing business in China We source a variety of fabrics from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we operate three upholstery manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China.  The      Chinese economy is characterized by extensive state ownership, control, and regulation.  Therefore, our business is continually subject to the risk of changes in Chinese laws and regulations that could have an adverse effect on our suppliers and      manufacturing operations.  Any changes in policies governing tariffs, imports and exports, taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property, and financial regulations could have an adverse      effect on our business.  Further, the Chinese legal system is continuing to develop and evolve, and the enforcement of rules and regulations is not always consistent or uniform.  Moreover, any potential civil unrest, natural disasters, or other      threats could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in China.  The Chinese economy poses additional risks to our business, including fluctuating rates of inflation and currency exchange rates, a declining labor force participation rate, and      rising employee wages.  In addition, changes in the political climate or trade policy of the United States, such as increased duties or tariffs on Chinese imports, may adversely affect our business.  Any of the risks associated with our Chinese      operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results. We may have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements being used for products and services. We rely on outside sources for various products and services, including yarn and other raw materials, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics, and services such as      weaving and finishing.  Increased reliance on outsourcing lowers our capital investment and fixed costs, but it decreases the amount of control that we have over certain elements of our production capacity.  Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw      materials or other required products or services from our outside suppliers on a timely and cost-effective basis, especially if alternative suppliers cannot be immediately obtained, could disrupt our production and damage our financial results. Write-offs or write-downs of assets would result in a decrease in our earnings and shareholders’ equity. The company has long-lived assets, primarily consisting of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and other intangible assets.  ASC Topic 360 establishes an impairment      accounting model for long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment and requires the company to assess for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered.  ASC Topic      350 requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered. Although no material write-downs were experienced in the past several fiscal years, we closed our Anderson, South Carolina upholstery fabrics facility during the second      quarter fiscal 2019. As a result of this plant closure, we recorded inventory markdowns totaling $1.6 million, which was mostly offset by a gain on the sale of property, plant, and equipment of $1.5 million.24Since April 1, 2019, our goodwill increased $15.7 million in connection with our acquisitions of Read Window Products, LLC and eLuxury, LLC.  As of April 28, 2019, our      evaluation resulted in no impairment losses. Management will continue to carefully review this assessment and impairment indicators each quarter. Identifying and assessing whether impairment indicators exist, or if events or changes in circumstances have occurred, including market conditions, operating results,      competition and general economic conditions, requires significant judgment. Any of such future actions could result in charges that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations, and there is no assurance that      future write-downs of fixed assets, goodwill, or other intangible assets will not occur if business conditions were to deteriorate. Changes in the price, availability, and quality of raw materials could increase our costs or cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would      result in decreased earnings. We depend upon outside suppliers for most of our raw material needs, and we rely upon outside suppliers for component materials such as yarn and unfinished fabrics, as well      as for certain services such as finishing and weaving.  Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of these goods and services could have a negative effect on our production costs and ability to meet the demands of our customers, which      would affect our ability to generate sales and earnings.  In many cases, we are not able to pass through increased costs of raw materials or increased production costs to our customers through price increases.  In particular, many of our basic raw      materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products.  For this reason, our material costs are especially sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil.  Increases in prices for oil,      petrochemical products or other raw materials and services provided by outside suppliers can significantly increase our costs and negatively affect earnings.  Beginning in the second quarter and continuing through the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we      began to experience higher raw material prices and resulting impacts on our profits, after which these prices leveled off and returned to pre-escalation levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Higher raw material prices would result in      downward pressure on our profit margins and earnings. Increases in energy costs would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect earnings. Higher prices for electricity, natural gas, and fuel increase our production and shipping costs.  A significant shortage, increased prices, or interruptions in the      availability of these energy sources would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers and would be likely to adversely affect our earnings.  In many cases, we are not able to pass along the full extent of increases in      our production costs to customers through price increases.  Energy costs have varied significantly during recent fiscal years and remain a volatile element of our costs.  Increases in energy costs could have a negative effect on our earnings. Business difficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings. We currently have several customers that account for a substantial portion of our sales.  In the mattress fabrics segment, several large bedding manufacturers have large      market shares and comprise a significant portion of our mattress fabric sales, with Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC accounting for approximately 18% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019. The 18% of the company’s overall sales include sales to      customers who are also subcontractors for Serta Simmons Holding, LLC.  In the upholstery fabrics segment, La-Z-Boy Incorporated accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2019, and several other large furniture      manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales.  A business failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of our major customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, could cause a significant loss in sales, an      adverse effect on our earnings, and difficulty in collection of our trade accounts receivable.25Loss of market share due to competition would result in declines in sales and could result in losses or decreases in earnings. Our business is highly competitive and fragmented, and we face significant competition from a large number of competitors, both foreign and domestic.  We compete with many      other manufacturers of fabric, as well as converters who source fabrics from various producers and market them to manufacturers of furniture and bedding.  In many cases, these fabrics are sourced from foreign suppliers who have a lower cost structure      than the company.  Additionally, our e-commerce business competes with many other online retailers.  The highly competitive nature of our business in each of our segments means we are constantly subject to the risk of losing market share.  As a      result of increased competition, there have been deflationary pressures on the prices for many of our products, which make it more difficult to pass along increased operating costs such as raw materials, energy or labor in the form of price increases      and puts downward pressure on our profit margins.  Also, the wide range of product offerings in our business can make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design, styling, finish, and other techniques. If we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends, our sales and earnings may decline. Demand for various types of upholstery fabrics and mattress coverings changes over time due to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture and bedding.  Our      success in marketing our fabrics depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in home furnishings.  If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline.  In addition,      incorrect projections about the demand for certain products could cause the accumulation of excess raw material or finished goods inventory, which could lead to inventory mark-downs and decreases in earnings. Increasing dependence on information technology systems comes with specific risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could have an      adverse effect on our business. We increasingly rely on technology systems and infrastructure.  Additionally, we rely on third-party service providers in connection with the maintenance thereof and the      execution of certain business processes.  In fiscal 2018, we launched a new platform for direct sales to retailers of bedding accessory products, and in fiscal 2019 we acquired a majority interest in an e-commerce retailer of bedding accessories and      other home goods.  Greater dependence on technology systems and e-commerce heightens the risk of potential vulnerabilities from system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss, and      other unforeseen events.  Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons.  With the growing      use and rapid evolution of technology, including internet selling, cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks.  There is also the risk of our exposure to theft of confidential information,      intentional vandalism, industrial espionage, and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system, infrastructure, or result in data leakage in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners.  Failures of      technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could damage our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities.  Additionally, the devotion of additional resources to the security of our information technology      systems in the future could significantly increase our costs of doing business or otherwise adversely impact our financial results.26Our home accessories segment could be adversely affected by increased fees from online sales channels or by the loss of one or more leading online sales      channels. Products for our home accessories segment are sold through our own eLuxury-branded website, as well as through a number of leading online retailers for specialty home goods.      These third-party platforms charge seller’s fees through a variety of commission, referral, or other fee structures.  Increases in these fees could require us to increase product prices, which could result in reduced sales if customers are unwilling      to pay these increased prices or could result in lowering our gross margins on products sold if we are unable to fully pass on these increased fees.  As a result, increased fees charged by our third-party online sales channels could have a material      adverse effect on the results of operations for our home accessories segment. Additionally, the loss of one or more of these leading online retail sales channels would limit our available sales opportunities and, if we are unable to replace such      sales opportunities, could cause a significant loss in sales and an adverse effect on our earnings. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent others from using our copyrights or trademarks in connection with the sale of competitive products. We may      be subject to claims that our products or trademarks infringe intellectual property rights of others. We currently hold, or have registration applications pending for, numerous trademarks and copyrights for various product and trade names, logos, and fabric designs in the      United States and certain foreign countries.  We view such intellectual property, along with any unregistered copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade names, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, and proprietary technologies, as an important      part of our business. These intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection against infringement or piracy, may not prevent competitors from developing and marketing products that are similar to or competitive with our fabric      designs, mattress pads, or other products, and may be costly and time-consuming to protect and enforce. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights and confidential information to the same extent      as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect and enforce our intellectual property, we may be unable to prevent other companies from using our fabric designs or trademarks in connection with competitive products, which could      adversely affect our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition. We may be subject to claims that our products, advertising, or trademarks infringe the intellectual property rights of others. The defense of these claims, even if we are      ultimately successful, may result in costly litigation, and if we are not successful in our defense, we could be subject to injunctions and liability for damages or royalty obligations, and our sales, profitability, cash flows and financial condition      could be adversely affected. We have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions, which could involve certain risks and uncertainties.Acquisitions have been and may continue to be an important element of our business strategy. Acquisitions involve numerous inherent challenges, such as properly evaluating acquisition opportunities, properly evaluating risks and other diligence        matters, ensuring adequate capital availability, and balancing other resource constraints. There are risks and uncertainties related to acquisitions, including difficulties integrating acquired operations, technology, personnel, and financial and        other systems; unrealized sales expectations from the acquired business; unrealized synergies and cost-savings; unknown or underestimated liabilities; diversion of management attention form running our existing businesses; and potential loss of key        management employees of the acquired business. In addition, internal control over financial reporting of acquired companies may not be up to required standards. Our integration activities may place substantial demand on our management, operational        resources, and financial and internal control systems. Customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business, technology, service, or product could also have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business.27We are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our sales and earnings. We have been, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including environmental matters, product liability, and employment disputes, some of which      claim significant damages.  We face the continual business risk of exposure to claims that our operations have caused personal injury or property damage, including the related risk of damage to our brand and reputation in conjunction with such      claims.  We maintain insurance against product liability claims and in some cases have indemnification agreements with regard to environmental claims, but there can be no assurance that these arrangements will continue to be available on acceptable      terms or that such arrangements will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred.  Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that claims against the company will not have a material adverse impact on our earnings or      financial condition.  We are also subject to various laws and regulations in our business, including those relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment.  We could incur substantial costs as a result of      noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws or other regulations. We must comply with a number of governmental regulations applicable to our business, and changes in those regulations could adversely affect our business. Our products and raw materials are and will continue to be subject to regulation in the United States by various federal, state, and local regulatory authorities.  In      addition, other governments and agencies in other jurisdictions regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and raw materials.  Also, rules and restrictions regarding the importation of fabrics and other materials, including      custom duties, tariffs, quotas and other regulations, are continually changing.  Environmental laws, labor laws, tax regulations, and other regulations continually affect our business.  All of these rules and regulations can and do change from time      to time, which can increase our costs or require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution.  Changes in the rules and regulations applicable to our business may negatively      impact our sales and earnings. "
14,CULP,CULP INC,2018-07-13,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS Our business is subject to risks and uncertainties.  In addition to the matters described above under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information,” set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause a material adverse change in our results of operations or financial condition.  The risks described below are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods. Continued economic uncertainty could negatively affect our sales and earnings. Overall demand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding, which is subject to variations in the general economy.  Because purchases of furniture or bedding are discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products is sometimes more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products.  Economic downturns can affect consumer spending habits and demand for home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decrease in our sales and earnings.  Economic uncertainty has caused a decrease in consumer spending and demand for home furnishings, including goods that incorporate our products.  If these conditions persist, our business will be negatively affected. It has been challenging to maintain and increase sales levels in the upholstery fabrics segment. Increased competition and fragmentation of the upholstery fabrics business, including a dramatic shift to imported fabrics and resulting price deflation for upholstery fabrics, have led to a significant reduction in the size of our upholstery business.  Opportunities for growth and profitability gains for this segment are encouraging, but there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or consistently grow this business in the future. Greater reliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or raw materials increases the likelihood of disruptions to our supply chain or our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. We rely significantly on operations in distant locations, especially China, and in addition we have been purchasing a significant share of our products and raw materials from offshore sources, particularly Asia and Turkey.  At the same time, our domestic manufacturing capacity for the upholstery fabrics segment has been greatly reduced.  These changes have caused us to rely on a much longer supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do not control, both of which are inherently subject to greater risks of delay or disruption.  In addition, operations and sourcing in foreign areas are subject to the risk of changing local governmental rules, taxes, changes in import rules or customs, tariffs, potential political unrest, or other threats that could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in foreign areas or sourcing products overseas.  Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies can affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United States.  Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies can have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those countries.  Any of the risks associated with foreign operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results. 17 Our business faces several risks associated with doing business in China We source a variety of fabrics from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we operate five upholstery manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China.  The Chinese economy is characterized by extensive state ownership, control, and regulation.  Therefore, our business is continually subject to the risk of changes in Chinese laws and regulations that could have an adverse effect on our suppliers and manufacturing operations.  Any changes in policies governing tariffs, imports and exports, taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property, and financial regulations could have an adverse effect on our business.  Further, the Chinese legal system is continuing to develop and evolve, and the enforcement of rules and regulations is not always consistent or uniform.  Moreover, any potential civil unrest, natural disasters, or other threats could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in China.  The Chinese economy poses additional risks to our business, including fluctuating rates of inflation and currency exchange rates, a declining labor force participation rate, and rising employee wages.  In addition, changes in the political climate or trade policy of the United States, such as increased duties or tariffs on Chinese imports, may adversely affect our business.  Any of the risks associated with our Chinese operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results. We may have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements being used for products and services. We rely on outside sources for various products and services, including yarn and other raw materials, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics, and services such as weaving and finishing.  Increased reliance on outsourcing lowers our capital investment and fixed costs, but it decreases the amount of control that we have over certain elements of our production capacity.  Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw materials or other required products or services from our outside suppliers on a timely and cost effective basis, especially if alternative suppliers cannot be immediately obtained, could disrupt our production and damage our financial results. Write-offs or write-downs of assets would result in a decrease in our earnings and shareholders’ equity. The company has long-lived assets, primarily consisting of property, plant and equipment, goodwill, and to a lesser extent other intangible assets.  ASC Topic 360 establishes an impairment accounting model for long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment and requires the company to assess for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered.  ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered. Although no material write-downs were experienced in the past several fiscal years, we recently announced the closure of our Anderson, SC upholstery fabrics facility during the first quarter fiscal 2019.  Currently, management estimates that the fair market value of our property, plant, and equipment exceeds its carrying value by approximately $400,000, and for this reason, no charge for impairment is expected to be recorded in connection with this decision. However, we are currently working with our customers to fulfill any outstanding or future orders, and through this process, we will be able to determine a good faith estimate of any inventory write-downs. 18 Our goodwill has increased during fiscal 2018 in connection with our acquisition of Read Window Products, LLC and is expected to increase further due our recent acquisition of eLuxury in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. There is no assurance that future write-downs of fixed assets, goodwill, or other intangible assets will not occur if business conditions were to deteriorate. Changes in the price, availability, and quality of raw materials could increase our costs or cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would result in decreased earnings. We depend upon outside suppliers for most of our raw material needs, and we rely upon outside suppliers for component materials such as yarn and unfinished fabrics, as well as for certain services such as finishing and weaving.  Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of these goods and services could have a negative effect on our production costs and ability to meet the demands of our customers, which would affect our ability to generate sales and earnings.  In many cases, we are not able to pass through increased costs of raw materials or increased production costs to our customers through price increases.  In particular, many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products.  For this reason, our material costs are especially sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil.  Increases in prices for oil, petrochemical products or other raw materials and services provided by outside suppliers can significantly increase our costs and negatively affect earnings.  Late in fiscal 2018, we began to experience higher raw material prices and resulting impacts on our profits.  A continuation of this trend would result in continuing downward pressure on our profit margins and earnings. Increases in energy costs would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect earnings. Higher prices for electricity, natural gas, and fuel increase our production and shipping costs.  A significant shortage, increased prices, or interruptions in the availability of these energy sources would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers, and would be likely to adversely affect our earnings.  In many cases, we are not able to pass along the full extent of increases in our production costs to customers through price increases.  Energy costs have varied significantly during recent fiscal years, and remain a volatile element of our costs.  Increases in energy costs could have a negative effect on our earnings. Business difficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings. We currently have several customers that account for a substantial portion of our sales.  In the mattress fabrics segment, several large bedding manufacturers have large market shares and comprise a significant portion of our mattress fabric sales, with Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC accounting for approximately 25% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018.  In the upholstery fabrics segment, La-Z-Boy Incorporated accounted for approximately 12% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2018, and several other large furniture manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales.  A business failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of our major customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, could cause a significant loss in sales, an adverse effect on our earnings, and difficulty in collection of our trade accounts receivable. 19 Loss of market share due to competition would result in declines in sales and could result in losses or decreases in earnings. Our business is highly competitive, and we face significant competition from a large number of competitors, both foreign and domestic.  We compete with many other manufacturers of fabric, as well as converters who source fabrics from various producers and market them to manufacturers of furniture and bedding.  In many cases, these fabrics are sourced from foreign suppliers who have a lower cost structure than the company.  The highly competitive nature of our business in both segments means we are constantly subject to the risk of losing market share.  As a result of increased competition, there have been deflationary pressures on the prices for many of our products, which make it more difficult to pass along increased operating costs such as raw materials, energy or labor in the form of price increases and puts downward pressure on our profit margins.  Also, the wide range of product offerings in our business can make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design, styling, finish, and other techniques. If we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends, our sales and earnings may decline. Demand for various types of upholstery fabrics and mattress coverings changes over time due to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture and bedding.  Our success in marketing our fabrics depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in home furnishings.  If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline.  In addition, incorrect projections about the demand for certain products could cause the accumulation of excess raw material or finished goods inventory, which could lead to inventory mark-downs and decreases in earnings. Increasing dependence on information technology systems comes with specific risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We increasingly rely on technology systems and infrastructure.  In fiscal 2018, we launched a new platform for direct sales to retailers of bedding accessory products, and in fiscal 2019 we acquired a majority interest in an e-commerce retailer of bedding accessories and other home goods.  Greater dependence on technology systems and e-commerce heightens the risk of potential vulnerabilities from system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss, and other unforeseen events.  Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons.  With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, including internet selling, cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks.  There is also the risk of our exposure to theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage, and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system, infrastructure, or result in data leakage in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners.  Failures of technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could damage our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities. 20 We are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our sales and earnings. We have been, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including environmental matters, product liability, and employment disputes, some of which claim significant damages.  We face the continual business risk of exposure to claims that our operations have caused personal injury or property damage.  We maintain insurance against product liability claims and in some cases have indemnification agreements with regard to environmental claims, but there can be no assurance that these arrangements will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such arrangements will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred.  Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that claims against the company will not have a material adverse impact on our earnings or financial condition.  We are also subject to various laws and regulations in our business, including those relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment.  We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws or other regulations. We must comply with a number of governmental regulations applicable to our business, and changes in those regulations could adversely affect our business. Our products and raw materials are and will continue to be subject to regulation in the United States by various federal, state, and local regulatory authorities.  In addition, other governments and agencies in other jurisdictions regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and raw materials.  Also, rules and restrictions regarding the importation of fabrics and other materials, including custom duties, tariffs, quotas and other regulations, are continually changing.  Environmental laws, labor laws, tax regulations, and other regulations continually affect our business.  All of these rules and regulations can and do change from time to time, which can increase our costs or require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution.  Changes in the rules and regulations applicable to our business may negatively impact our sales and earnings.  "

In addition to the matters described above under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information,” set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause a material adverse change in our results of operations or financial condition. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or not presently deemed material by us also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in future periods.Continued economic uncertainty could negatively affect our sales and earnings.Overall demand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding, which is subject to variations in the general economy. Because purchases of furniture or bedding are discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products is sometimes more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products. Economic downturns can affect consumer spending habits and demand for home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decrease in our sales and earnings. Economic uncertainty has caused a decrease in consumer spending and demand for home furnishings, including goods that incorporate our products. If these conditions persist, our business will be negatively affected. It has been challenging to maintain and increase sales levels in the upholstery fabrics segment. Increased competition and fragmentation of the upholstery fabrics business, including a dramatic shift to imported fabrics and resulting price deflation for upholstery fabrics, have led to a significant reduction in the size of our upholstery business. Opportunities for growth and profitability gains for this segment are encouraging, but there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or consistently grow this business in the future. Greater reliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or raw materials increases the likelihood of disruptions to our supply chain or our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. We rely significantly on operations in distant locations, particularly China, and in addition we have been purchasing a significant share of our products and raw materials from offshore sources, particularly Asia and Turkey. At the same time, our domestic manufacturing capacity for the upholstery fabrics segment has been greatly reduced. These changes have caused us to rely on a much longer supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do not control, both of which are inherently subject to greater risks of delay or disruption. In addition, operations and sourcing in foreign areas are subject to the risk of changing local governmental rules, taxes, changes in import rules or customs, potential political unrest, or other threats that could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in foreign areas or sourcing products overseas. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies can affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United States. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies can have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those countries. Any of the risks associated with foreign operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results.15Our business faces several risks associated with doing business in China. We source a variety of fabrics from a limited number of strategic suppliers in China, and we operate three upholstery manufacturing facilities in Shanghai, China. The Chinese economy is characterized by extensive state ownership, control, and regulation. Therefore, our business is continually subject to the risk of changes in Chinese laws and regulations that could have an adverse effect on our suppliers and manufacturing operations. Any changes in policies governing tariffs, imports and exports, taxation, inflation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property, and financial regulations could have an adverse effect on our business. Further, the Chinese legal system is continuing to develop and evolve, and the enforcement of rules and regulations is not always consistent or uniform. Moreover, any potential civil unrest, natural disasters, or other threats could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in China. The Chinese economy poses additional risks to our business, including fluctuating rates of inflation and currency exchange rates, a declining labor force participation rate, and rising employee wages. In addition, changes in the political climate or trade policy of the United States, such as increased duties or tariffs on Chinese imports, may adversely affect our business. Any of the risks associated with our Chinese operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results.We may have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements being used for products and services. We rely on outside sources for various products and services, including yarn and other raw materials, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics, and services such as weaving and finishing. Increased reliance on outsourcing lowers our capital investment and fixed costs, but it decreases the amount of control that we have over certain elements of our production capacity. Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw materials or other required products or services from our outside suppliers on a timely and cost effective basis, especially if alternative suppliers cannot be immediately obtained, could disrupt our production and damage our financial results. Write-offs or write-downs of assets would result in a decrease in our earnings and shareholders’ equity. The company has long-lived assets, primarily consisting of property, plant and equipment and goodwill and to a lesser extent other intangible assets. ASC Topic 360 establishes an impairment accounting model for long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment and requires the company to assess for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered. ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered. Although no material write-downs were experienced in the past several fiscal years, there is no assurance that future write-downs of fixed assets or goodwill will not occur if business conditions deteriorate.Changes in the price, availability, and quality of raw materials could increase our costs or cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would result in decreased earnings. We depend upon outside suppliers for most of our raw material needs, and we rely upon outside suppliers for component materials such as yarn and unfinished fabrics, as well as for certain services such as finishing and weaving. Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of these goods and services could have a negative effect on our production costs and ability to meet the demands of our customers, which would affect our ability to generate sales and earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass through increased costs of raw materials or increased production costs to our customers through price increases. In particular, many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our material costs are especially sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. Increases in prices for oil, petrochemical products or other raw materials and services provided by outside suppliers could significantly increase our costs and negatively affect earnings. Although our raw material costs were lower during our most recent fiscal years, higher raw material prices could have a negative effect on our profits in the future.16Increases in energy costs would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect earnings. Higher prices for electricity, natural  gas, and fuel increase our  production and shipping costs. A significant shortage, increased prices, or interruptions in the availability of these energy sources would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers, and would be likely to adversely affect our earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass along the full extent of increases in our production costs to customers through price increases. Energy costs have varied significantly during recent fiscal years, and remain a volatile element of our costs. Increases in energy costs could have a negative effect on our earnings.Business difficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings. We currently have several customers that account for a substantial portion of our sales. In the mattress fabrics segment, several large bedding manufacturers have large market shares and comprise a significant portion of our mattress fabric sales, with Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC accounting for approximately 22% of consolidated net sales, and Tempur Sealy International, Inc. accounting for approximately 10% of consolidated net sales, in fiscal 2017. In the upholstery fabrics segment, La-Z-Boy Incorporated accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2017, and several other large furniture manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales. A business failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of our major customers, or the loss of one or more of these customers, could cause a significant loss in sales, an adverse effect on our earnings, and difficulty in collection of our trade accounts receivable.Loss of market share due to competition would result in declines in sales and could result in losses or decreases in earnings. Our business is highly competitive, and in particular the upholstery fabric industry is fragmented and is experiencing an increase in the number of competitors. As a result, we face significant competition from a large number of competitors, both foreign and domestic. We compete with many other manufacturers of fabric, as well as converters who source fabrics from various producers and market them to manufacturers of furniture and bedding. In many cases, these fabrics are sourced from foreign suppliers who have a lower cost structure than the company. The highly competitive nature of our business in both segments means we are constantly subject to the risk of losing market share. As a result of increased competition, there have been deflationary pressures on the prices for many of our products, which make it more difficult to pass along increased operating costs such as raw materials, energy or labor in the form of price increases and puts downward pressure on our profit margins. Also, the wide range of product offerings in our business can make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design, styling, finish, and other techniques.If we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends, our sales and earnings may decline. Demand for various types of upholstery fabrics and mattress coverings changes over time due to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture and bedding. Our success in marketing our fabrics depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, incorrect projections about the demand for certain products could cause the accumulation of excess raw material or finished goods inventory, which could lead to inventory mark-downs and decreases in earnings.17Increasing dependence on information technology systems comes with specific risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We increasingly rely on technology systems and infrastructure.

Also, the large number of competitors and wide range of product offerings in our business can make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design, styling, finish, and other techniques. If we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends, our sales and earnings may decline. Demand for various types of upholstery fabrics and mattress coverings changes over time due to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture and bedding. Our success in marketing our fabrics depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, incorrect projections about the demand for certain products could cause the accumulation of excess raw material or finished goods inventory, which could lead to inventory mark-downs and decreases in earnings. Increasing dependence on information technology systems comes with specific risks, including cybersecurity breaches and data leaks, which could have an adverse effect on our business. We increasingly rely on technology systems and infrastructure. Greater dependence on such systems heightens the risk of potential vulnerabilities from system failure and malfunction, breakdowns due to natural disasters, human error, unauthorized access, power loss, and other unforeseen events. Data privacy breaches by employees and others with or without authorized access to our systems poses risks that sensitive data may be permanently lost or leaked to the public or other unauthorized persons. With the growing use and rapid evolution of technology, not limited to cloud-based computing and mobile devices, there are additional risks of unintentional data leaks. There is also the risk of our exposure to theft of confidential information, intentional vandalism, industrial espionage, and a variety of cyber-attacks that could compromise our internal technology system and infrastructure, or result in data leakage in-house or at our third-party providers and business partners. Failures of technology or related systems, or an improper release of confidential information, could damage our business or subject us to unexpected liabilities.   16   We are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our sales and earnings. We have been, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including environmental matters, product liability, and employment disputes, some of which claim significant damages. We face the continual business risk of exposure to claims that our business operations have caused personal injury or property damage. We maintain insurance against product liability claims and in some cases have indemnification agreements with regard to environmental claims, but there can be no assurance that these arrangements will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such arrangements will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that claims against the company will not have a material adverse impact on our earnings or financial condition. We are also subject to various laws and regulations in our business, including those relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws or other regulations. We must comply with a number of governmental regulations applicable to our business, and changes in those regulations could adversely affect our business. Our products and raw materials are and will continue to be subject to regulation in the United States by various federal, state, and local regulatory authorities. In addition, other governments and agencies in other jurisdictions regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and raw materials. Also, rules and restrictions regarding the importation of fabrics and other materials, including custom duties, quotas and other regulations, are continually changing. Environmental laws, labor laws, tax regulations, and other regulations continually affect our business. All of these rules and regulations can and do change from time to time, which can increase our costs or require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution. Changes in the rules and regulations applicable to our business may negatively impact our sales and earnings. "

In addition to the matters described above under “Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information,” set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause a material adverse change in our results of operations or financial condition. Continued economic weakness could negatively affect our sales and earnings. Overall demand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding, which is subject to variations in the general economy. Because purchases of furniture or bedding are discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products is sometimes more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products. Economic downturns can affect consumer spending habits and demand for home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decrease in our sales and earnings. Continuing weak economic conditions have caused a decrease in consumer spending and demand for home furnishings, including goods that incorporate our products.  If these conditions persist, our business will be negatively affected. It has been challenging to maintain and increase sales levels in the upholstery fabrics segment. Although sales have increased in recent years for our upholstery fabrics segment, we experienced declines in sales for this business for many years prior to the last five fiscal years. Increased competition and fragmentation of the upholstery fabrics business, including a dramatic shift to imported fabrics and resulting price deflation for upholstery fabrics, have led to a significant reduction in the size of our upholstery business. Opportunities for growth and profitability gains for this segment are encouraging, but there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or consistently grow this business in the future. Increased reliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or raw materials increases the likelihood of disruptions to our supply chain or our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. We now rely significantly on operations in distant locations, particularly China, and in addition we have been purchasing an increasing share of our products and raw materials from offshore sources. At the same time, our domestic manufacturing capacity for the upholstery fabrics segment has been greatly reduced. These changes have caused us to place greater reliance on a much longer supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do not control, both of which are inherently subject to greater risks of delay or disruption. In addition, operations and sourcing in foreign areas are subject to the risk of changing local governmental rules, taxes, changes in import rules or customs, potential political unrest, or other threats that could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in foreign areas or sourcing products overseas. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies can affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United States. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies can have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those countries. Any of the risks associated with foreign operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results.   15   We may have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements increasingly being used for products and services. We rely on outside sources for various products and services, including yarn and other raw materials, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics, and services such as weaving and finishing. Increased reliance on outsourcing lowers our capital investment and fixed costs, but it decreases the amount of control that we have over certain elements of our production capacity. Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw materials or other required products or services from our outside suppliers on a timely and cost effective basis, especially if alternative suppliers cannot be immediately obtained, could disrupt our production and damage our financial results. Write-offs or write-downs of assets would result in a decrease in our earnings and shareholders’ equity. The company has long-lived assets, consisting mainly of property, plant and equipment and goodwill. ASC Topic 360 establishes an impairment accounting model for long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment and requires the company to assess for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered. ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered. Although no write-downs were experienced in the past several fiscal years, there is no assurance that future write-downs of fixed assets or goodwill will not occur if business conditions deteriorate. Changes in the price, availability, and quality of raw materials could increase our costs or cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would result in decreased earnings. We depend upon outside suppliers for most of our raw material needs, and increasingly we rely upon outside suppliers for component materials such as yarn and unfinished fabrics, as well as for certain services such as finishing and weaving. Fluctuations in the price, availability, and quality of these goods and services could have a negative effect on our production costs and ability to meet the demands of our customers, which would affect our ability to generate sales and earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass through increased costs of raw materials or increased production costs to our customers through price increases. In particular, many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our material costs are especially sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. Increases in prices for oil, petrochemical products or other raw materials and services provided by outside suppliers could significantly increase our costs and negatively affect earnings.  Increases in market prices for certain fibers and yarns had a material adverse impact on our profit margins during fiscal 2011 and 2012.  Although our raw material costs were more stable during our two most recent fiscal years, higher raw material prices could have a negative effect on our profits in the future. Increases in energy costs would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect earnings. Higher prices for electricity, natural gas, and fuel increase our production and shipping costs. A significant shortage, increased prices, or interruptions in the availability of these energy sources would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers, and would be likely to adversely affect our earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass along the full extent of increases in our production costs to customers through price increases.  Energy costs have varied significantly during recent fiscal years, and remain a volatile element of our costs. Further increases in energy costs could have a negative effect on our earnings.   16   Business difficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings. We currently have several customers that account for a substantial portion of our sales. In the mattress fabrics segment, several large bedding manufacturers have large market shares and comprise a significant portion of our mattress fabric sales, with Serta Simmons Holdings, LLC accounting for approximately 22% of consolidated net sales, and Tempur Sealy International, Inc. accounting for approximately 11% of consolidated net sales, in fiscal 2014.  In the upholstery fabrics segment, La-Z-Boy Incorporated accounted for approximately 13% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2014, and several other large furniture manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales. A business failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of our major customers could cause a significant loss in sales, an adverse effect on our earnings, and difficulty in collection of our trade accounts receivable. Loss of market share due to competition would result in declines in sales and could result in losses or decreases in earnings. Our business is highly competitive, and in particular the upholstery fabric industry is fragmented and is experiencing an increase in the number of competitors. As a result, we face significant competition from a large number of competitors, both foreign and domestic. We compete with many other manufacturers of fabric, as well as converters who source fabrics from various producers and market them to manufacturers of furniture and bedding. In many cases, these fabrics are sourced from foreign suppliers who have a lower cost structure than the company. The highly competitive nature of our business means we are constantly subject to the risk of losing market share.  As a result of increased competition, there have been deflationary pressures on the prices for many of our products, which make it more difficult to pass along increased operating costs such as raw materials, energy or labor in the form of price increases and puts downward pressure on our profit margins. Also, the large number of competitors and wide range of product offerings in our business can make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design, styling, finish, and other techniques. If we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends, our sales and earnings may decline. Demand for various types of upholstery fabrics and mattress coverings changes over time due to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture and bedding.

In addition, other governments and agencies in other jurisdictions regulate the manufacture, sale, and distribution of our products and raw materials. For example, standards for flame resistance of fabrics have been recently adopted on a nationwide basis. Also, rules and restrictions regarding the importation of fabrics and other materials, including custom duties, quotas, and other regulations, are continually changing. Environmental laws, labor laws, tax regulations, and other regulations continually affect our business. All of these rules and regulations can and do change from time to time, which can increase our costs or require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution.

Environmental laws, labor laws, tax regulations and other regulations continually affect our business. All of these rules and regulations can and do change from time to time, which can increase our costs or require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution. Changes in the rules and regulations applicable to our business may negatively impact our sales and earnings.   18   "

Because purchases of furniture or bedding are discretionary purchases for most individuals and businesses, demand for these products is sometimes more easily influenced by economic trends than demand for other products. Economic downturns can affect consumer spending habits and demand for home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products and therefore can cause a decrease in our sales and earnings. Continuing weak economic conditions have caused a decrease in consumer spending and demand for home furnishings, including goods that incorporate our products.  If these conditions persist, our business will be negatively affected. It has been difficult to maintain and increase sales levels in the upholstery fabrics segment. Although sales stabilized in fiscal 2010 and 2011 for our upholstery fabrics segment, we experienced declines in sales for this business for many years prior to the last two. Increased competition and fragmentation of the upholstery fabrics business, including a dramatic shift to imported fabrics and resulting price deflation for upholstery fabrics, have led to a significant reduction in the size of our upholstery business. Opportunities for growth and profitability gains for this segment are encouraging, but there is no assurance that we will be able to maintain or consistently grow this business in the future. Increased reliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or raw materials increases the likelihood of disruptions to our supply chain or our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis. We now rely significantly on operations in distant locations, particularly China, and in addition we have been purchasing an increasing share of our products and raw materials from offshore sources. At the same time, our domestic manufacturing capacity for the upholstery fabrics segment has been greatly reduced. These changes have caused us to place greater reliance on a much longer supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do not control, both of which are inherently subject to greater risks of delay or disruption. In addition, operations and sourcing in foreign areas are subject to the risk of changing local governmental rules, taxes, changes in import rules or customs, potential political unrest, or other threats that could disrupt or increase the costs of operating in foreign areas or sourcing products overseas. Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus other currencies can affect our financial results because a significant portion of our operations are located outside the United States. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies can have a negative impact on our sales of products produced in those countries. Any of the risks associated with foreign operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases in operating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact our ultimate financial results.   15   We may have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements increasingly being used for products and services. We rely on outside sources for various products and services, including yarn and other raw materials, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics, and services such as weaving and finishing. Increased reliance on outsourcing lowers our capital investment and fixed costs, but it decreases the amount of control that we have over certain elements of our production capacity. Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw materials or other required products or services from our outside suppliers on a timely and cost effective basis, especially if alternative suppliers cannot be immediately obtained, could disrupt our production and damage our financial results. Further write-offs or write-downs of assets would result in a decrease in our earnings and shareholders’ equity. The company has long-lived assets, consisting mainly of property, plant and equipment and goodwill. ASC Topic 360 establishes an impairment accounting model for long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment and requires the company to assess for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered. ASC Topic 350 requires that goodwill be tested at least annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recovered. Restructuring activities and other tests for impairment have resulted and could in the future result in the write-down of a portion of our long-lived assets and a corresponding reduction in earnings and net worth. In fiscal 2009, we experienced $8 million in write-downs of property, plant, and equipment in the upholstery fabrics segment. Although no significant write-downs were experienced in fiscal 2011 or 2010, there is no assurance that future write-downs of fixed assets or goodwill will not occur if business conditions deteriorate. Changes in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could increase our costs or cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would result in decreased earnings. We depend upon outside suppliers for most of our raw material needs, and increasingly we rely upon outside suppliers for component materials such as yarn and unfinished fabrics, as well as for certain services such as finishing and weaving. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of these goods and services could have a negative effect on our production costs and ability to meet the demands of our customers, which would affect our ability to generate sales and earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass through increased costs of raw materials or increased production costs to our customers through price increases. In particular, many of our basic raw materials are petrochemical products or are produced from such products. For this reason, our material costs are especially sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicals and the underlying price of oil. Increases in prices for oil, petrochemical products or other raw materials and services provided by outside suppliers could significantly increase our costs and negatively affect earnings.  Increases in market prices for certain fibers and yarns had a material adverse impact on our profit margins during fiscal 2011, and a continuation of high raw material prices is likely to have a negative effect on our profits in the future. Increases in energy costs would increase our operating costs and could adversely affect earnings. Higher prices for electricity, natural gas and fuel increase our production and shipping costs. A significant shortage, increased prices, or interruptions in the availability of these energy sources would increase the costs of producing and delivering products to our customers, and would be likely to adversely affect our earnings. In many cases, we are not able to pass along the full extent of increases in our production costs to customers through price increases.  Energy costs have varied significantly during fiscal 2011 and 2010, and remain a volatile element of our costs. Further increases in energy costs could have a negative effect on our earnings.   16   Business difficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decrease in our sales and earnings. We currently have several customers that account for a substantial portion of our sales. In the mattress fabrics segment, several large bedding manufacturers have large market shares and comprise a significant portion of our mattress fabric sales, with the parent company of Serta (National Bedding) and Simmons accounting for approximately 18% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2011. In the upholstery fabrics segment, La-Z-Boy Incorporated accounted for approximately 12% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2011, and several other large furniture manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales. A business failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of our major customers could cause a significant loss in sales, an adverse effect on our earnings, and difficulty in collection of our trade accounts receivable. Loss of market share due to competition would result in declines in sales and could result in losses or decreases in earnings. Our business is highly competitive, and in particular the upholstery fabric industry is fragmented and is experiencing an increase in the number of competitors. As a result, we face significant competition from a large number of competitors, both foreign and domestic. We compete with many other manufacturers of fabric, as well as converters who source fabrics from various producers and market them to manufacturers of furniture and bedding. In many cases, these fabrics are sourced from foreign suppliers who have a lower cost structure than the company. The highly competitive nature of our business means we are constantly subject to the risk of losing market share. Our sales of upholstery fabrics have decreased significantly over the past ten fiscal years due in part to the increased number of competitors in the marketplace, especially foreign sources of fabric. As a result of increased competition, there have been deflationary pressures on the prices for many of our products, which make it more difficult to pass along increased operating costs such as raw materials, energy or labor in the form of price increases and puts downward pressure on our profit margins. Also, the large number of competitors and wide range of product offerings in our business can make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design, styling, finish and other techniques. If we fail to anticipate and respond to changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends, our sales and earnings may decline. Demand for various types of upholstery fabrics and mattress coverings changes over time due to fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture and bedding. Our success in marketing our fabrics depends upon our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in home furnishings. If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these products may decline. In addition, incorrect projections about the demand for certain products could cause the accumulation of excess raw material or finished goods inventory, which could lead to inventory mark-downs and further decreases in earnings. We are subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adversely impact our sales and earnings. We are, and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, including environmental matters, product liability and employment disputes, some of which claim significant damages. We face the continual business risk of exposure to claims that our business operations have caused personal injury or property damage. We maintain insurance against product liability claims and in some cases have indemnification agreements with regard to environmental claims, but there can be no assurance that these arrangements will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that such arrangements will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that claims against the company will not have a material adverse impact on our earnings or financial condition. We are also subject to various laws and regulations in our business, including those relating to environmental protection and the discharge of materials into the environment. We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under environmental laws or other regulations.   17   We must comply with a number of governmental regulations applicable to our business, and changes in those regulations could adversely affect our business. Our products and raw materials are and will continue to be subject to regulation in the United States by various federal, state and local regulatory authorities. In addition, other governments and agencies in other jurisdictions regulate the manufacture, sale and distribution of our products and raw materials. For example, standards for flame resistance of fabrics have been recently adopted on a nationwide basis. Also, rules and restrictions regarding the importation of fabrics and other materials, including custom duties, quotas and other regulations, are continually changing. Environmental laws, labor laws, tax regulations and other regulations continually affect our business. All of these rules and regulations can and do change from time to time, which can increase our costs or require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution.

fiscal 2008, energy prices increased significantly, in part due to increases in the price of oil and other petrochemical products.  Although some price increases were implemented to offset the effect of these increased costs, we were not able to fully recoup these costs, and operating margins were negatively affected.  Energy costs eased somewhat in fiscal 2009 and 2010, but remain a volatile

short-term costs that may not be offset by increased savings or efficiencies. Over several years prior to the most recent fiscal year, we undertook significant restructuring activities, which involved closing manufacturing plants, realigning manufacturing assets, and changes in product strategy.  These actions lowered our manufacturing costs and increased efficiency, but they also involved significant costs, including inventory markdowns, the write-off or write-down of assets, severance costs for terminated employees, contract termination costs, equipment moving costs, and similar charges.  These charges caused significant decreases in earnings in prior fiscal years.  There were no new restructuring initiatives in fiscal 2010, and we do not have any current plans for additional restructuring activities, but a significant and unanticipated downturn in business could lead to additional restructuring changes in the future.    20   We are subject to litigation and environmental

restructuring activities,which have involved closing manufacturing plants, realigning manufacturingassets, and changes in product strategy.  These actions are intendedto lower manufacturing costs and increase efficiency, but they involvesignificant costs, including inventory markdowns, the write-off or write-down ofassets, severance costs for terminated employees, contract termination costs,equipment moving costs, and similar charges.  These charges havecaused a decrease in earnings in the short-term.  In addition, duringthe time that restructuring activities are underway, manufacturinginefficiencies are caused by moving equipment, realignment of assets, personnelchanges, and by the consolidation process for certainfunctions.  Unanticipated difficulties in restructuring activities ordelays in accomplishing our goals could cause the costs of our restructuringinitiatives to be greater than anticipated and the results achieved to besignificantly lower, which would negatively impact our results of operations andfinancial condition.  17 Oursales and profits have been declining in the upholstery fabricssegment. We may notbe able to restore the upholstery fabrics segment to consistent profitability.Sales have continued to decline significantly, especially for U.S. producedfabrics.  We have undertaken a number of significant restructuringactions in recent years to address our profitability, including (i) closing anumber of upholstery fabric manufacturing facilities, (ii) establishingfacilities in China to take advantage of a lower cost environment and greaterproduct diversity, and (iii) outsourcing certain production functions in theU.S., including yarn production, finishing of decorative fabrics, and someweaving.  The success of our restructuring efforts depends on a numberof variables, including our ability to consolidate certain functions, managemanufacturing processes with lower direct involvement, manage a longer supplychain, and similar issues.  Current market conditions in the furnitureindustry are weak, and our sales of upholstery fabrics have continued to declinein this economic environment.  There is no assurance that we will beable to manage our restructuring activities successfully or restore theupholstery fabrics segment to consistent profitability, especially if theeconomy does not recover in the near future. Increasedreliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or raw materialsincreases the likelihood of disruptions to our supply chain or our ability todeliver products to our customers on a timely basis. We nowrely significantly on operations in distant locations, particularly China, andin addition we have been purchasing an increasing share of our products and rawmaterials from offshore sources.  At the same time, our domesticmanufacturing capacity for the upholstery fabrics segment has been greatlyreduced.  These changes have caused us to place greater reliance on amuch longer supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do notcontrol, both of which are inherently subject to greater risks of delay ordisruption.  In addition, operations and sourcing in foreign areas aresubject to the risk of changing local governmental rules, taxes, changes inimport rules or customs, potential political unrest, or other threats that coulddisrupt or increase the costs of operating in foreign areas or sourcing productsoverseas.  Changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus othercurrencies can affect our financial results because a significant portion of ouroperations are located outside the United States.  Strengthening ofthe U.S. dollar against other currencies can have a negative impact on our salesof products produced in those countries.  Any of the risks associatedwith foreign operations and sources could cause unanticipated increases inoperating costs or disruptions in business, which could negatively impact ourultimate financial results. Wemay have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements increasingly beingused for products and services. We arerelying more on outside sources for various products and services, includingyarn and other raw materials, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics, andservices such as weaving and finishing.  Increased reliance onoutsourcing lowers our capital investment and fixed costs, but it decreases theamount of control that we have over certain elements of our productioncapacity.  Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw materials orother required products or services from our outside suppliers on a timely andcost effective basis, especially if alternative suppliers cannot be immediatelyobtained, could disrupt our production and damage our financialresults.  18 Furtherwrite-offs or write-downs of assets would result in a decrease in our earningsand shareholders’ equity. Thecompany has long-lived assets, consisting mainly of property, plant andequipment and goodwill.  SFAS No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairmentor Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,” establishes an impairment accounting modelfor long-lived assets such as property, plant, and equipment and requires thecompany to assess for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstancesindicate that the carrying value of the asset may not berecovered.  SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,”requires that goodwill be tested at least annually for impairment or wheneverevents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assetmay not be recovered. Restructuring activities and other tests for impairmenthave resulted and could in the future result in the write-down of a portion ofour long-lived assets and a corresponding reduction in earnings and networth.  In fiscal 2008, the company experienced asset write-downs ofproperty, plant and equipment of $792,000, of which $503,000 related to theupholstery fabrics segment and $289,000 related to the mattress fabricssegment.  In fiscal 2009, we experienced an additional $8 million insimilar write-downs in the upholstery fabrics segment.  In addition,during fiscal 2009 we recorded a charge of $27.2 million for the establishmentof a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred taxassets.  The valuation of this asset must be tested on a periodicbasis against the likelihood of realizing its full value, and our continuedability to carry this asset at its full value was not justified due touncertainty in demand for furniture and mattresses and overall weak economiccondition. Changesin the price, availability and quality of raw materials could increase our costsor cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would result indecreased earnings. We dependupon outside suppliers for most of our raw material needs, and increasingly werely upon outside suppliers for component materials such as yarn and unfinishedfabrics, as well as for certain services such as finishing andweaving.  Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of thesegoods and services could have a negative effect on our production costs andability to meet

electricity, natural gas and fuel increase our production andshipping costs.  A significant shortage, increased prices, orinterruptions in the availability of these energy sources would increase thecosts of producing and delivering products to our customers, and would be likelyto adversely affect our earnings.  In many cases, we are not able topass along the full extent of increases in our production costs to customersthrough price increases.  During fiscal 2008, energy prices increasedsignificantly, in part due to increases in the price of oil and otherpetrochemical products.  Although some price increases wereimplemented to offset the effect of these increased costs, we were not able tofully recoup these costs, and operating margins were negativelyaffected.  Energy costs eased in fiscal 2009, but remain a volatileelement of our costs.  Further increases in energy costs could have anegative effect on our earnings.  19 Businessdifficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decrease in oursales and earnings. Wecurrently have several customers that account for a substantial portion of oursales.  In the mattress fabric segment, several large beddingmanufacturers have large market shares and comprise a significant portion of ourmattress fabric sales, with Serta (National Bedding) accounting forapproximately 13% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2009.  In theupholstery fabrics segment, La-Z-Boy Incorporated accounted for approximately12% of consolidated net sales during fiscal 2009, and several other largefurniture manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales.  Abusiness failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of ourmajor customers could cause a significant loss in sales, an adverse effect onour earnings, and difficulty in collection of our trade accountsreceivable. Ifwe are unable to manage our cash effectively, we will not have funds availableto repay debt and to maintain the flexibility necessary for successful operationof our business. Ourability to meet our cash obligations depends on our operating cash flow, accessto trade credit, and our ability to borrow under our debtagreements.  In addition to the cash needs of operating our business,we have substantial debt repayments that are due over the next several years onour unsecured senior notes and the debt we issued to acquire Bodet & Horstduring fiscal 2009 (see notes 2 and 12 to the consolidated financialstatements).  Our ability to generate cash flow going forward willdepend upon our ability to generate profits from our business, and we have notbeen able to generate earnings on a consistent basis in recentyears.  If we are not able to generate cash during the coming year, wemay not be able to provide the funds needed to operate and maintain our businessor to make payments on our debt as they become due. Furtherloss of market share due to competition would result in further declines insales and could result in additional losses or decreases inearnings. Ourbusiness is highly competitive, and in particular the upholstery fabric industryis fragmented and is experiencing an increase in the number ofcompetitors.  As a result, we face significant competition from alarge number of competitors, both foreign and domestic.  We competewith many other manufacturers of fabric, as well as

structure than the company.  Thehighly competitive nature of our business means we are constantly subject to therisk of losing market share.  Our sales have decreased significantlyover the past six years due in part to the increased number of competitors inthe marketplace, especially foreign sources of fabric.  As a result ofincreased competition, there have been deflationary pressures on the prices formany of our products, which make it more difficult to pass along increasedoperating costs such as raw materials, energy or labor in the form of priceincreases and puts downward pressure on our profit margins.  Also, thelarge number of competitors and wide range of product offerings in our businesscan make it more difficult to differentiate our products through design,styling, finish and

mattress coverings change over time dueto fashion trends and changing consumer tastes for furniture andbedding.  Our success in marketing our fabrics depends upon ourability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in homefurnishings.  If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, oursales of these products may decline.  In addition, incorrectprojections about the demand for certain products could cause the accumulationof excess raw material or finished goods inventory, which could lead toinventory mark-downs and further decreases in earnings. Acontinuation of the current economic downturn could result in a further decreasein our sales and earnings. Overalldemand for our products depends upon consumer demand for furniture and bedding,which is subject to variations in the general economy.  Becausepurchases of furniture or bedding are discretionary purchases for mostindividuals and businesses, demand for these products is sometimes more easilyinfluenced by economic trends than demand for otherproducts.  Economic downturns can affect consumer spending habits anddemand for home furnishings, which reduces the demand for our products andtherefore could cause a decrease in our sales and earnings.  Therecent economic slowdown has caused a decrease in consumer spending and demandfor home furnishings, including goods that incorporate ourproducts. Weare subject to litigation and environmental regulations that could adverselyimpact our sales and earnings. We are,and in the future may be, a party to legal proceedings and claims, includingenvironmental matters, product liability and employment disputes, some of whichclaim significant damages.  We face the continual business risk ofexposure to claims that our business operations have caused personal injury orproperty damage.  We maintain insurance against product liabilityclaims and in some cases have indemnification agreements with regard toenvironmental claims, but there can be no assurance that these arrangements willcontinue to be available on acceptable terms or that such arrangements will beadequate for liabilities actually incurred.  Given the inherentuncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that claims against thecompany will not have a material adverse impact on our earnings or financialcondition.  We are also subject to various laws and regulations in ourbusiness, including those relating to environmental protection and the dischargeof materials into the environment.  We could incur substantial costsas a result of noncompliance with or liability for cleanup or other costs ordamages under environmental laws or other regulations.  21 Wemust comply with a number of governmental regulations applicable to ourbusiness, and changes in those regulations could adversely affect ourbusiness. Ourproducts and raw materials are and will continue to be subject to regulation inthe United States by various federal, state and local regulatoryauthorities.  In addition, other governments and agencies in otherjurisdictions regulate the manufacture, sale and distribution of our productsand raw materials.  For example, standards for flame resistance offabrics have been recently adopted on a nationwide basis.  Also, rulesand restrictions regarding the importation of fabrics and other materials,including custom duties, quotas and other regulations, are continuallychanging.  Environmental laws, labor laws, tax regulations and otherregulations continually affect our business.  All of these rules andregulations can and do change from time to time, which can increase our costs orrequire us to make changes in our manufacturing processes, product mix, sourcesof products and raw materials, or distribution.  Changes in the rulesand regulations applicable to our business may negatively impact our sales andearnings. Thecompany’s market capitalization and shareholders equity have fallen below thelevel required for continued listing on the New York StockExchange. Our commonstock is currently traded on the New York Stock Exchange(NYSE).  Under the NYSE’s current listing standards, we are requiredto have market capitalization or shareholders equity of more than $50 million tomaintain compliance with continued listing standards, pursuant to a recentlyenacted temporary rule that is expected to become permanent.  At theend of fiscal 2009, the company’s market capitalization and shareholders equityare both now below $50 million.  As a result, the company is listed as“below compliance” with NYSE listing standards, and we have been required tosubmit a plan regarding our ability to return to compliance with thesestandards. This plan was submitted in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 and hasbeen approved by the NYSE.  Regardless of this plan, if our averagemarket capitalization over a 30 trading-day period is below $15 million pursuantto the temporary rule, under standard NYSE rules, the NYSE would be expected tostart immediate delisting procedures.  If the company is not able toreturn to and maintain compliance with the NYSE standards, our stock will bedelisted from trading on the NYSE, resulting in the need to find another marketon which our stock can be listed or causing our stock to cease to be traded onan active market, which could result in a reduction in the liquidity for ourstock and a reduction in demand for our stock.  At May 3, 2009, ourshareholders’ equity was $48 million and the consecutive 30 trading-day periodaverage market capitalization was $45.8 million. "
10,CULP,CULP INC,2006-07-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business is subject to risks and  uncertainties.  In addition to the mattersdescribed  above  under   ""Cautionary   Statement   Concerning   Forward-LookingInformation,"" set forth below are some of the risks and uncertainties that couldcause a material  adverse  change in our  results  of  operations  or  financialcondition.                                       15Restructuring  initiatives  create  short-term  costs  that may not be offset byincreased  savings  or  efficiencies.Over  the past  several  years,  we have  undertaken  significant  restructuringactivities,   which  have  involved  closing  manufacturing  plants,  realigningmanufacturing  assets,  and  changes  in product  strategy.  These  actions  areintended to lower manufacturing costs and increase efficiency,  but they involvesignificant  costs,  including the write-off or write-down of assets,  severancecosts for terminated  employees,  contract  termination costs,  equipment movingcosts, and similar charges.  These charges have caused a decrease in earnings inthe short-term.  In addition,  during the time that restructuring activities areunderway,   manufacturing   inefficiencies   are  caused  by  moving  equipment,realignment of assets,  personnel changes, and by the consolidation  process forcertain  functions.  Unanticipated  difficulties in restructuring  activities ordelays in  accomplishing  our goals could  cause the costs of our  restructuringinitiatives  to be greater  than  anticipated  and the  results  achieved  to besignificantly lower, which would negatively impact our results of operations andfinancial condition.Our sales have been  declining,  and we have  reported net losses in each of thepast eight (8) fiscal  quarters  ending  April 30,  2006.We may not be able to restore  the  upholstery  fabrics  segment  to  consistentprofitability. Our overall sales declined almost 9% during the past fiscal year,and they have  declined by more than 32% since  fiscal 2002.  In the  upholsteryfabrics  segment,  sales are down  significantly,  and they have been  decliningrapidly for U.S.  produced  fabrics.  We have undertaken a number of significantrestructuring  actions in recent years to address our  profitability,  including(i) consolidating  production assets and purchasing more efficient  equipment inthe  mattress  fabrics  segment,  (ii)  closing a number  of U.S.  manufacturingfacilities in the upholstery  fabrics  segment,  (iii)  establishing  upholsteryfabrics  facilities in China to take advantage of a lower cost  environment  andgreater product diversity, and (iv) outsourcing certain production functions, inthe U.S.,  including  yarn  production,  and  finishing of  decorative  fabrics.Successful  completion  of  our  restructuring  plans  depends  on a  number  ofvariables,  including  our  ability to  consolidate  certain  functions,  managemanufacturing processes with lower direct involvement,  managing a longer supplychain, and similar issues. Sales continue to decline in both segments.  There isno  assurance  that  we will be able  to  manage  our  restructuring  activitiessuccessfully to restore the company,  especially the upholstery fabrics segment,to profitability.Increased reliance on offshore operations and foreign sources of products or rawmaterials  increases the  likelihood of  disruptions  to our supply chain or ourability to deliver  products to our customers on a timely  basis.During recent years,  the company has  established  operations in China,  and inaddition we have been  purchasing  an  increasing  share of our products and rawmaterials  from  offshore  sources,  primarily in China.  At the same time,  ourdomestic  manufacturing  capacity for the  upholstery  fabrics  segment has beengreatly reduced. These changes have caused the company to place greater relianceon a much longer supply chain and on a larger number of suppliers that we do notcontrol,  which are inherently  subject to greater risks of delay or disruption.In addition, operations and sourcing in foreign areas are subject to the risk ofchanging local governmental  rules,  taxes,  changes in import rules or customs,potential  political unrest, or other threats that could disrupt or increase thecosts of operating in foreign areas or sourcing products overseas. Also, changesin relative  values of  currencies  could  increase our costs.  Any of the risksassociated  with  foreign  operations  and  sources  could  cause  unanticipatedincreases in operating costs or disruptions in business,  which could negativelyimpact the company's ultimate financial results.We may have difficulty managing the outsourcing arrangements  increasingly beingused by the company for products and services.The company is relying more on outside  sources for various  products andservices, including raw material, greige (unfinished) fabrics, finished fabrics,and services such as weaving and  finishing.  Increased  reliance on outsourcinglowers our capital  investment  and fixed costs,  but it decreases the amount ofcontrol  that  we  have  over  certain  elements  of  our  production  capacity.Interruptions in our ability to obtain raw materials, other required products orservices  from our  outside  suppliers  on a timely  and cost  effective  basis,especially  if  alternative  suppliers  cannot be  immediately  obtained,  coulddisrupt our production and damage our financial results.                                       16Further  write-offs or  write-downs  of upholstry  fabric  segment  assets wouldresult in a decrease in our earnings.The company has long-lived assets, consisting mainly of property, plant andequipment.  Accounting  rules require that these assets be tested for impairmentof their valuation at least annually,  as well as upon the occurrence of certainevents.  When assets are taken out of service,  which has  occurred  recently onseveral occasions in connection with our restructuring activities,  they must betested for impairment,  which can result in significant write-downs in the valueof those assets.  Restructuring  activities and other tests for impairment  haveresulted and could in the future  result in the  write-down  of a portion of ourlong-lived  assets and a  corresponding  reduction in earnings and net worth. Infiscal 2006, the company  experienced  asset  write-downs of approximately  $6.0million, all in the upholstry fabrics segment.Write-offs  of assets or weak  financial  performance  could  cause us to breachfinancial  covenants  in our debt  agreements.At the end of fiscal 2006,  the company had $47.7 million of long-term  debt, ofwhich  approximately  $42.4 million was owed on unsecured senior notes issued in1998.  Under the debt agreements that govern our long-term debt, we are requiredto maintain  compliance  with certain  financial  covenants,  including  minimumtangible  net worth,  debt to  tangible  capitalization,  debt to  capital,  andinterest  and lease  payment  coverage.  The  company  has been able to maintaincompliance with these financial covenants.  However, in some cases the ""cushion""between the required  financial  covenants and our actual financial  performancehas  been  shrinking.   For  example,  our  tangible  net  worth  has  decreasedsignificantly  in recent years due to asset  write-offs  and  operating  losses.Additional write-offs of assets or continued operating losses would decrease thecompany's tangible net worth further,  which could lead to a breach of financialcovenants and a default under our loan agreements.  In particular, we reported adeferred  income tax asset of $27.3 million as of April 30, 2006.  Our continuedability to carry this  deferred tax asset on our balance sheet at its full valuedepends upon our ability to generate  taxable income in the future  attributableto U.S. operations.  A write-off of a portion or all of this asset would cause abreach of the minimum  tangible net worth covenant that applies to our unsecuredsenior notes.  A breach of our debt  covenants  would give the lenders under ourlong term debt  agreements the right to declare all of the debt  immediately dueand payable and to terminate our right to obtain further borrowings.  If such anevent  occurred,  it is unlikely  that we would be able to repay all of our debtfrom current resources,  and there is no assurance that we would be able to findalternative sources of financing.Changes in the price,  availability  and quality of raw materials could increaseour costs or cause production delays and sales interruptions, which would resultin decreased earnings.The company  depends upon outside  suppliers for most of its raw material needs,and increasingly we rely upon outside suppliers for component  materials such asyarn and unfinished  fabrics,  as well as for certain services such as finishingand weaving.  Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of these goodsand services could have a negative effect on our production costs and ability tomeet the demands of our  customers,  which would  affect our ability to generatesales and  earnings.  In many cases,  we are not able to pass through  increasedcosts of raw materials or increased  production  costs to our customers  throughprice   increases.   In  particular,   many  of  our  basic  raw  materials  arepetrochemical  products or are produced from such products. For this reason, ourmaterial costs are especially  sensitive to changes in prices for petrochemicalsand the  underlying  price of oil.  Increases  in prices for oil,  petrochemicalproducts or other raw materials and services provided by outside suppliers couldsignificantly increase our costs and negatively affect earnings.Increases in energy costs would increase our operating costs and could adverselyaffect earnings.Higher prices for electricity,  natural gas and fuel increase our production andshipping costs. A significant  shortage,  increased  prices, or interruptions inthe  availability  of these energy sources would increase the costs of producingand  delivering  products  to our  customers,  and would be likely to  adverselyaffect  our  earnings.  In many  cases,  we are not able to pass  along the fullextent  of  increases  in  our  production  costs  to  customers  through  priceincreases.  During fiscal 2006, energy prices increased  significantly,  in partdue to supply  disruptions  caused by hurricanes.  Although some price increaseswere implemented to offset the effect of these increased costs, we were not ableto fully recoup these costs,  and operating  margins were  negatively  affected.Further increases in energy costs could have a negative effect on our earnings.                                       17Business  difficulties or failures of large customers could result in a decreasein our sales and  earnings.The company  currently  has several  customers  that  account for a  substantialportion of its sales.  In the mattress  fabric  segment,  several  large beddingmanufacturers have large market shares and comprise a significant portion of ourmattress  fabric  sales.  In  the  upholstery  fabrics  segment,  La-Z-Boy  Inc.accounted  for 13% of  consolidated  net sales during  fiscal 2006,  and severalother large furniture  manufacturers comprised a significant portion of sales. Abusiness failure or other significant financial difficulty by one or more of ourmajor  customers  could cause a significant  loss in sales, an adverse effect onour earnings, and collection of our trade accounts receivable.If we are  unable  to  manage  our cash  effectively,  we will  not  have  fundsavailable to repay debt and to maintain the flexibility necessary for successfuloperation of our business.Our ability to meet our cash  obligations  depends on our  operating  cash flow,access to trade credit, and our ability to borrow under our debt agreements.  Inaddition to the cash needs of operating our business,  we have  substantial debtrepayments  that are due over the next  several  years on our  unsecured  seniornotes (see note 10 to the consolidated  financial  statements).  During the pastfiscal year, in spite of incurring losses, we were able to generate  substantialcash flow through  reductions of working  capital.  Our ability to generate cashflow going  forward  will rely to a heavier  degree on our  ability to  generateprofits from our business,  and we have not been able to generate  earnings on aconsistent basis in recent quarters.  If we are not able to generate cash duringthe coming  year,  we may not be able to provide the funds needed to operate andmaintain our business or to make payments on our debt as they become due.Further loss of market share due to competition would result in further declinesin sales and could result in  additional  losses or  decreases in earnings.Our business is highly  competitive,  and in particular  the  upholstery  fabricindustry  is  fragmented  and is  experiencing  an  increase  in the  number  ofcompetitors. As a result, we face significant competition from a large number ofcompetitors, both foreign and domestic. We compete with many other manufacturersof fabric,  as well as converters who source fabrics from various  producers andmarket them to  manufacturers  of furniture  and bedding.  In many cases,  thesefabrics are sourced from foreign  suppliers who have a lower cost structure thanthe  company.  The  highly  competitive  nature  of our  business  means  we areconstantly  subject to the risk of losing market share. Our sales have decreasedsignificantly  over the past five years due in part to the  increased  number ofcompetitors  in the  marketplace,  especially  foreign  sources of fabric.  As aresult of increased  competition,  there have been deflationary pressures on theprices for many of our  products,  which makes it more  difficult  to pass alongincreased operating costs such as raw materials,  energy or labor in the form ofprice  increases and puts downward  pressure on our profit  margins.  Also,  thelarge number of competitors and wide range of product  offerings in our businesscan  make it more  difficult  to  differentiate  our  products  through  design,styling, finish and other techniques.If we fail to anticipate  and respond to changes in consumer  tastes and fashiontrends,  our sales  and  earnings  may  decline.Demand for various types of  upholstery  fabrics and mattress  coverings  changeover time due to fashion trends and changing  consumer  tastes for furniture andbedding.  Our  success in  marketing  our  fabrics  depends  upon our ability toanticipate and respond in a timely manner to fashion trends in home furnishings.If we fail to identify and respond to these changes, our sales of these productsmay decline.  In addition,  incorrect  projections  about the demand for certainproducts could cause the  accumulation  of excess raw material or finished goodsinventory,  which could lead to inventory  write-downs and further  decreases inearnings.                                       18An  economic  downturn  could  result in a decrease  in our sales and  earnings.Overall demand for our products  depends upon consumer  demand for furniture andbedding,  which  is  subject  to  variations  in the  general  economy.  Becausepurchases  of  furniture  or  bedding  are  discretionary   purchases  for  mostindividuals and  businesses,  demand for these products is sometimes more easilyinfluenced by economic trends than demand for other products. Economic downturnscan affect  consumer  spending  habits and  demand for home  furnishings,  whichreduces the demand for our products and therefore  could cause a decrease in oursales and earnings.We are subject to litigation and environmental  regulations that could adverselyimpact  our sales and  earnings.We are,  and in the  future  may be, a party to legal  proceedings  and  claims,including environmental matters, product liability and employment disputes, someof which claim  significant  damages.  We face the  continual  business  risk ofexposure to claims that our business  operations  have caused personal injury orproperty damage.  We maintain  insurance against product liability claims and insome cases have indemnification  agreements with regard to environmental claims,but there can be no  assurance  that  these  arrangements  will  continue  to beavailable on  acceptable  terms or that such  arrangements  will be adequate forliabilities  actually  incurred.  Given the inherent  uncertainty of litigation,there can be no  assurance  that  claims  against  the  company  will not have amaterial  adverse  impact on our  earnings or financial  condition.  We are alsosubject  to  various  laws and  regulations  in our  business,  including  thoserelating to  environmental  protection  and the discharge of materials  into theenvironment.  We could incur substantial costs as a result of noncompliance withor liability for cleanup or other costs or damages under  environmental  laws orother regulations.The company must comply with a number of governmental  regulations applicable toour  business,  and  changes in those  regulations  could  adversely  affect ourbusiness.Our products and raw materials are and will continue to be subject to regulationin the United States by various federal, state and local regulatory authorities.In addition,  other governments and agencies in other jurisdictions regulate themanufacture,  sale and  distribution  of our  products  and raw  materials.  Forexample, standards for flame resistance of fabrics have been recently introducedin the state of California, and additional standards are scheduled to apply on anationwide basis beginning July 1, 2007. Also, rules and restrictions  regardingthe importation of fabrics and other materials,  including custom duties, quotasand other regulations, are continually changing. Environmental laws, labor laws,tax regulations and other regulations also continually affect our business.  Allof these rules and  regulations  can and do change from time to time,  which canincrease our costs or require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes,product mix, sources of products and raw materials, or distribution.  Changes inthe rules and regulations  applicable to our business may negatively  impact oursales and earnings.The company's market  capitalization  and shareholders  equity have fallen belowthe level  required for continued  listing on the New York Stock  Exchange.Our common  stock is  currently  traded on the New York Stock  Exchange  (NYSE).Under the NYSE's  current  listing  standards,  we are  required  to have marketcapitalization  or  shareholders  equity of more than $75  million  to  maintaincompliance with continued listing standards. The company's market capitalizationis now below $75  million,  and as of the end of fiscal  2006 our  shareholders'equity was $74.5  million.  As a result,  the  company  will be listed as ""belowcompliance"" with NYSE listing standards, and we must submit a plan regarding ourability to return to compliance with these standards. If the company is not ableto return to compliance with the NYSE standards, our stock will be delisted fromtrading on the NYSE,  resulting in the need to find another  market on which ourstock  can be  listed  or  causing  our stock to cease to be traded on an activemarket,  which could result in a reduction in the  liquidity for our stock and areduction in demand for our stock.                                       19"
