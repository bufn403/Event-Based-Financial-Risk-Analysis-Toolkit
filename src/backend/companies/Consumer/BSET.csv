The risk factors below represent what we believe are the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position or future financial results. Risks Related to the Coronavirus Pandemic The coronavirus global pandemic which caused a significant disruption in non-essential retail commerce may continue to have a material adverse impact upon our financial condition and results of operations. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country imposed varying degrees of restriction on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including non-essential retail commerce. As a result of these circumstances, we temporarily closed our dedicated stores, our manufacturing locations and many of our warehouses. In addition, many of our office personnel were working remotely. By the end of June 2020, we had reopened all of our retail stores that had been temporarily closed. However, continuing logistical challenges faced by the entire home furnishings industry resulting from COVID-related labor shortages and supply chain disruptions created significant delays in order fulfillment and increasing backlogs as we were not able to produce and ship at the incoming rate of wholesale and retail orders. Gradual decreases in wholesale and retail backlogs over the course of 2022 were driven by a lower rate of incoming orders coupled with gradual easing of supply chain constraints. By the end of fiscal 2022, these issues have been substantially resolved. However, we cannot anticipate the impact of any future resurgence of COVID-19 upon our business, which could include, among other things, reductions in customer traffic to our retail stores, increased labor shortages and renewed supply chain disruptions. Should these conditions resume, this may have a material adverse impact on our ultimate financial condition and liquidity. Risks Related to Our Retail Operations We face a volatile retail environment and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending. Historically, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Should current economic conditions weaken, the current rate of housing starts decline, or rising inflation persist, consumer confidence and demand for home furnishings could deteriorate which could adversely affect our business through its impact on the performance of our Company-owned stores, as well as our licensees and the ability of a number of them to meet their obligations to us. Our retail stores face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings, including increasing on-line competition via the internet. The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, and dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers. National mass merchants such as Costco also have limited product offerings. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. We have also seen increasing competition from retailers offering consumers the ability to purchase home furnishings via the internet for home delivery, and this trend is expected to continue. Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer, and expansion into markets where we currently operate. Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 8  Our licensee-owned stores may not be able to meet their obligations to us. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable attributable to our network of licensee-owned stores. We also guarantee a limited number of leases of some of our licensees. If these stores do not generate the necessary level of sales and profits, the licensees may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us resulting in additional bad debt expenses and real estate related losses. We may incur significant future losses due to our recent acquisition of Noa Home If expected growth trends in Noa Home’s revenue fail to materialize, we may be unable to recover our investment in Noa Home, including any additional financial support we may find necessary to provide. This may result in significant operating losses from Noa Home which could have an adverse impact on our future cash flows and results of operations, including significant charges for the impairment of certain acquired assets including goodwill. Risks Related to Our Brand and Product Offerings Failure to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.  Sales of our furniture are dependent upon consumer acceptance of our designs, styles, quality and price. As with all retailers, our business is susceptible to changes in consumer tastes and trends. We attempt to monitor changes in consumer tastes and home design trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal marketing research, and communication with our retailers and design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies.  However, such tastes and trends can change rapidly and any delay or failure to anticipate or respond to changing consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, certain suppliers may require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to produce products in the quantities we desire. This long lead time may require us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale, thereby exposing us to risks relating to shifts in consumer demand and trends, and any downturn in the U.S. economy. Our success depends upon our brand, marketing and advertising efforts and pricing strategies, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, or if we are not successful in these efforts and strategies, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  Maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and drive increased traffic at both Company-owned and licensee-owned stores and to our website. Digital advertising and outreach continue to dominate our marketing expenditures. We are also investing heavily in our website and e-commerce. We plan to debut a new website in the second quarter of 2023 which will include improved navigation and on-line order capabilities designed to drive additional on-line sales. We cannot provide assurance that our marketing, advertising and other efforts to promote and maintain awareness of our brand will not require us to incur substantial costs. If these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Risks Related to Material Sourcing and Supply Our use of foreign sources of production for a portion of our products exposes us to certain additional risks associated with international operations. Our use of foreign sources for the supply of certain of our products exposes us to risks associated with overseas sourcing.  These risks are related to government regulation, volatile ocean freight costs, delays in shipments, extended lead time in ordering and, more recently, disruptions in supply due to plant shut-downs and shipping delays resulting from surges in COVID infections in other parts of the world. Governments in the foreign countries where we source our products may change their laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation and exchange controls which could make it more difficult to service our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings. 9  Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or cause production delays which might result in a decline in sales, either of which could adversely impact our earnings. We use various types of wood, foam, fibers, fabrics, leathers, and other raw materials in manufacturing our furniture. Certain of our raw materials, including fabrics, are purchased both abroad and domestically. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or a delay in manufacturing our products, which in turn could result in a delay in delivering products to our customers. For example, lumber prices fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand, which in turn impact availability. More recently, general price inflation brought on by labor and supply shortages have forced us to implement several general price increases in 2022 and 2021. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully pass along additional cost increases as they arise and rising inflation could have an adverse impact upon consumer demand for discretionary items such as home furnishings. Production delays or upward trends in raw material prices could result in lower sales or margins, thereby adversely impacting our earnings. Risks Related to Electronic Data Processing and Digital Information We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business.  Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our primary and back-up computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, natural disasters and errors by employees.  Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business computer systems or failure of our back-up systems could reduce our sales or result in longer production times.  If our critical business computer systems or back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them. We may incur costs and reputational harm resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing, storage and transmission of confidential information. We accept electronic payment cards in our stores and also gather certain personal identifiable information in the processing of our retail sales transactions. We also store and process confidential information pertaining to our employees and other third parties on our networks. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information. In addition, if there were a disclosure of confidential information provided by, or concerning, our employees, customers or other third parties, including through inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, or unauthorized access, our reputation could be harmed, and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and regulatory actions. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects. 10  "

Although unable to predict with certainty, we expect gradual decreases in wholesale and retail backlogs over the course of 2022 driven by an anticipated lower rate of future incoming orders coupled with gradual easing of supply chain constraints. If we are unable to reduce the backlogs and increase the speed of order fulfillment it is possible that some of our customers may begin to cancel existing orders and require refunds of deposits, which could have an adverse impact upon our liquidity and results of operations. While the home furnishings industry has fared much better during the pandemic than other sectors of the economy, the recent surges in COVID-19 cases due to new variants of the virus and the resurgence of inflation brought on by labor and supply shortages may have an adverse impact upon our business. Should these conditions persist for a prolonged period, this may have a continuing material adverse impact on our ultimate financial condition and liquidity. Risks Related to Our Retail Operations We face a volatile retail environment and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending. Historically, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects.

Digital advertising and outreach dominated our marketing expenditures for fiscal 2021 and 2020, with no change in strategy expected for 2022. We also expect to invest more heavily in our website in 2022 to improve the navigation and the ordering capabilities to increase web sales. We cannot provide assurance that our marketing, advertising and other efforts to promote and maintain awareness of our brand will not require us to incur substantial costs. If these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Risks Related to Material Sourcing and Supply Our use of foreign sources of production for a portion of our products exposes us to certain additional risks associated with international operations. Our use of foreign sources for the supply of certain of our products exposes us to risks associated with overseas sourcing.  These risks are related to government regulation, volatile ocean freight costs, delays in shipments, extended lead time in ordering and, more recently, disruptions in supply due to plant shut-downs and shipping delays resulting from surges in COVID infections in other parts of the world. Governments in the foreign countries where we source our products may change their laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation and exchange controls which could make it more difficult to service our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings. We have experienced recent increases in ocean freight costs coupled with a lack of availability of shipping containers resulting in reduced flow of products primarily from Asia. Continued product delays and extended order lead times may adversely affect our ability to service our customers and respond to changes in demand, resulting in the purchase of excess inventory in the face of declining demand, or lost sales due to insufficient inventory in the face of increasing demand, either of which would also have an adverse effect on our earnings or liquidity.        9                   Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or cause production delays which might result in a decline in sales, either of which could adversely impact our earnings. We use various types of wood, foam, fibers, fabrics, leathers, and other raw materials in manufacturing our furniture.

For example, lumber prices fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand, which in turn impact availability. More recently, general price inflation brought on by labor and supply shortages have forced us to implement four wholesale price increases during fiscal 2021. There is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully pass along additional cost increases as they arise, and rising inflation could have an adverse impact upon consumer demand for discretionary items such as home furnishings. Production delays or upward trends in raw material prices could result in lower sales or margins, thereby adversely impacting our earnings. Risks Related to Our Logistical Services Operations We may suffer adverse impacts from additional risks associated with the operations of Zenith, a freight transportation and logistics business. Zenith exposes us to certain risks common to that business, including, but not limited to: difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers which could result in increases in driver compensation and could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to maintain or grow our fleet; adverse impacts from unfavorable fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel; increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations in the highly regulated freight transportation industry; adverse impacts upon Zenith’s results of operations which may result from seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions; and the increased liability inherent with the operation of heavy over-the-road vehicles. Risks Related to Electronic Data Processing and Digital Information We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business.  Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our primary and back-up computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, natural disasters and errors by employees.  Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business computer systems or failure of our back-up systems could reduce our sales or result in longer production times.  If our critical business computer systems or back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them. We may incur costs and reputational harm resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing, storage and transmission of confidential information. We accept electronic payment cards in our stores and also gather certain personal identifiable information in the processing of our retail sales transactions.

Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer, and expansion into markets where we currently operate. Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our licensee-owned stores may not be able to meet their obligations to us. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable attributable to our network of licensee-owned stores. We also guarantee some of the leases of some of our licensees. If these stores do not generate the necessary level of sales and profits, the licensees may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us resulting in additional bad debt expenses and real estate related losses. Failure to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.  Sales of our furniture are dependent upon consumer acceptance of our designs, styles, quality and price. As with all retailers, our business is susceptible to changes in consumer tastes and trends. We attempt to monitor changes in consumer tastes and home design trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal marketing research, and communication with our retailers and design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies. However, such tastes and trends can change rapidly and any delay or failure to anticipate or respond to changing consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, certain suppliers may require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to produce products in the quantities we desire. This long lead time may require us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale, thereby exposing us to risks relating to shifts in consumer demand and trends, and any downturn in the U.S. economy.      7             Our success depends upon our brand, marketing and advertising efforts and pricing strategies, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, or if we are not successful in these efforts and strategies, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  Maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and drive increased traffic at both Company-owned and licensee-owned stores and to our website. Our advertising and marketing campaign utilizes television, direct mail, catalogs, newspapers, magazines, radio, the internet and social and other digital media in an effort to maintain and enhance our existing brand equity. We cannot provide assurance that our marketing, advertising and other efforts to promote and maintain awareness of our brand will not require us to incur substantial costs. If these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Our use of foreign sources of production for a portion of our products exposes us to certain additional risks associated with international operations. Our use of foreign sources for the supply of certain of our products exposes us to risks associated with overseas sourcing.  These risks are related to government regulation, volatile ocean freight costs, delays in shipments, and extended lead time in ordering. Governments in the foreign countries where we source our products may change their laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation and exchange controls which could make it more difficult to service our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings. We could also experience increases in the cost of ocean freight shipping which could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Shipping delays and extended order lead times may adversely affect our ability to respond to sudden changes in demand, resulting in the purchase of excess inventory in the face of declining demand, or lost sales due to insufficient inventory in the face of increasing demand, either of which would also have an adverse effect on our earnings or liquidity. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or cause production delays which might result in a decline in sales, either of which could adversely impact our earnings.  We use various types of wood, foam, fibers, fabrics, leathers, and other raw materials in manufacturing our furniture. Certain of our raw materials, including fabrics, are purchased both abroad and domestically. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or a delay in manufacturing our products, which in turn could result in a delay in delivering products to our customers. For example, lumber prices fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand, which in turn impact availability. Production delays or upward trends in raw material prices could result in lower sales or margins, thereby adversely impacting our earnings. We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business.  Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our primary and back-up computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, natural disasters and errors by employees.  Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business computer systems or failure of our back-up systems could reduce our sales or result in longer production times.  If our critical business computer systems or back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them. We may incur costs and reputational harm resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing, storage and transmission of confidential information. We accept electronic payment cards in our stores and also gather certain personal identifiable information in the processing of our retail sales transactions. We also store and process confidential information pertaining to our employees and other third parties on our networks. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information. In addition, if there were a disclosure of confidential information provided by, or concerning, our employees, customers or other third parties, including through inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination, or unauthorized access, our reputation could be harmed and we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and regulatory actions. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.      8             We may suffer adverse impacts from additional risks associated with the operations of Zenith, a freight transportation and logistics business. Zenith exposes us to certain risks common to that business, including, but not limited to: difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers which could result in increases in driver compensation and could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to maintain or grow our fleet; adverse impacts from unfavorable fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel; increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations in the highly regulated freight transportation industry; adverse impacts upon Zenith’s results of operations which may result from seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions; and the increased liability inherent with the operation of heavy over-the-road vehicles. "

The risk factors below represent what we believe are the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position or future financial results. We face a volatile retail environment and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending. Historically, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Should the current economic recovery falter or the current recovery in housing starts stall, consumer confidence and demand for home furnishings could deteriorate which could adversely affect our business through its impact on the performance of our Company-owned stores, as well as our licensees and the ability of a number of them to meet their obligations to us. Our retail stores face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings, including increasing on-line competition via the internet. The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, and dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers.

Our existing competitors or new entrants into our industry may use a number of different strategies to compete against us, including aggressive advertising, pricing and marketing, extension of credit to customers on terms more favorable than we offer, and expansion into markets where we currently operate. Competition from any of these sources could cause us to lose market share, revenues and customers, increase expenditures or reduce prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our licensee-owned stores may not be able to meet their obligations to us. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable attributable to our network of licensee-owned stores. We also guarantee some of the leases of some of our licensees. If these stores do not generate the necessary level of sales and profits, the licensees may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us resulting in additional bad debt expenses and real estate related losses.  7  Failure to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.  Sales of our furniture are dependent upon consumer acceptance of our designs, styles, quality and price. As with all retailers, our business is susceptible to changes in consumer tastes and trends. We attempt to monitor changes in consumer tastes and home design trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal marketing research, and communication with our retailers and design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies. However, such tastes and trends can change rapidly and any delay or failure to anticipate or respond to changing consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.  In addition, certain suppliers may require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to produce products in the quantities we desire. This long lead time may require us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale, thereby exposing us to risks relating to shifts in consumer demand and trends, and any downturn in the U.S. economy. Our success depends upon our brand, marketing and advertising efforts and pricing strategies, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, or if we are not successful in these efforts and strategies, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.  Maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and drive increased traffic at both Company-owned and licensee-owned stores. Our advertising and marketing campaign utilizes television, direct mail, catalogs, newspapers, magazines, radio and the internet in an effort to maintain and enhance our existing brand equity. We cannot provide assurance that our marketing, advertising and other efforts to promote and maintain awareness of our brand will not require us to incur substantial costs. If these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or cause production delays which might result in a decline in sales, either of which could adversely impact our earnings.  We use various types of wood, foam, fibers, fabrics, leathers, and other raw materials in manufacturing our furniture. Certain of our raw materials, including fabrics, are purchased both abroad and domestically. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or a delay in manufacturing our products, which in turn could result in a delay in delivering products to our customers. For example, lumber prices fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand, which in turn impact availability. Production delays or upward trends in raw material prices could result in lower sales or margins, thereby adversely impacting our earnings.  We rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, summarize results and manage our business.  Disruptions in both our primary and back-up systems could adversely affect our business and operating results. Our primary and back-up computer systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, natural disasters and errors by employees.  Though losses arising from some of these issues would be covered by insurance, interruptions of our critical business computer systems or failure of our back-up systems could reduce our sales or result in longer production times.  If our critical business computer systems or back-up systems are damaged or cease to function properly, we may have to make a significant investment to repair or replace them. We may incur costs resulting from security risks we face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information. We accept electronic payment cards in our stores. We may in the future become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of credit or debit card information, and we may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit or debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit) and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could distract our management from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned losses and expenses. Consumer perception of our brand could also be negatively affected by these events, which could further adversely affect our results and prospects.  8  We may suffer adverse impacts from additional risks associated with our entry into the freight transportation and logistics business following our acquisition of Zenith. Our entry into the freight transportation and logistics business through our acquisition of Zenith exposes us to certain risks common to that business, including, but not limited to: difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers which could result in increases in driver compensation and could adversely affect our profitability and our ability to maintain or grow our fleet; adverse impacts from unfavorable fluctuations in the availability and price of diesel fuel; increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations in the highly regulated freight transportation industry; and adverse impacts upon Zenith’s results of operations which may result from seasonal factors and harsh weather conditions.  9   "
12,BSET,BASSETT FURNITURE INDS,2015-01-22,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS The following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risk factors below represent what we believe are the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position or future financial results. We face a volatile retail environment and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending. The home furnishings industry has experienced a difficult period over the last seven years marked with depressed housing starts, high unemployment, changing consumer confidence and uncertain fiscal policies. While the economy has improved over the most recent three years, the pace of the recovery continues to be slow by historical standards and remains fragile. Historically, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Should the current economic recovery falter or the current recovery in housing starts stall, consumer confidence and demand for home furnishings could deteriorate which could adversely affect our business through its impact on the performance of our Company-owned stores, as well as our licensees and the ability of a number of them to meet their obligations to us.  Our use of foreign sources of production for a substantial portion of our products exposes us to certain additional risks associated with international operations. Our use of foreign sources for the supply of many of our products exposes us to risks associated with overseas sourcing.  These risks are related to government regulation, volatile ocean freight costs, delays in shipments, and extended lead time in ordering. Governments in the foreign countries where we source our products may change their laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation and exchange controls which could make it more difficult to service our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings. We could also experience increases in the cost of ocean freight shipping which could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Shipping delays and extended order lead times may adversely affect our ability to respond to sudden changes in demand, resulting in the purchase of excess inventory in the face of declining demand, or lost sales due to insufficient inventory in the face of increasing demand, either of which would also have an adverse effect on our earnings or liquidity. Our retail stores face significant competition from national, regional and local retailers of home furnishings. The retail market for home furnishings is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including national department stores, regional or independent specialty stores, and dedicated franchises of furniture manufacturers. National mass merchants such as Costco also have limited product offerings. We also compete with retailers that market products through store catalogs and the Internet. In addition, there are few barriers to entry into our current and contemplated markets, and new competitors may enter our current or future markets at any time. We have recently seen electronics and appliance retailers adding limited furniture products in their stores.

Our goal is to operate these stores at a level of modest profitability to enhance operating margins generated by our wholesale operation. To be successful, we need to increase our sales per store while decreasing the support costs as a percentage of sales. As part of our strategy, we must hire, train and retain a qualified staff of design consultants to improve the customer experience. Competition with other furniture retailers for qualified design consultants continues to increase. We also compete with other retailers for management personnel and appropriate retail locations. Failures and delays in implementing our retail strategies or failure to realize the benefits of these strategies could adversely impact our business and operating results.  Our licensee-owned stores may not be able to meet their obligations to us. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable attributable to our network of licensee-owned stores.

If these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.  Manufacturing realignments could result in a decrease in our near-term earnings. We regularly review and evaluate our domestic manufacturing operations and offshore (import) sourcing capabilities.  As a result, we sometimes realign those operations and capabilities and institute cost savings programs. These programs can include the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems and procedures and can include shifting domestic production to offshore sourcing or shifting offshore sourcing to domestic production. These realignments and cost savings programs generally involve some initial cost and can result in decreases in our near-term earnings until we achieve the expected cost reductions.  Failure to accomplish these actions as quickly as planned, or failure to fully achieve the expected cost reductions, could adversely impact our operating results and financial conditions. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or cause production delays which might result in a decline in sales, either of which could adversely impact our earnings.  We use various types of wood, foam, fibers, fabrics, leathers, and other raw materials in manufacturing our furniture.

Absent the IHFC transaction, we had not reported pretax income for any of the five fiscal years through November 26, 2011. Furthermore, significant earnings and cash flows previously realized from our investment in IHFC have ceased following the sale, and we have distributed a significant portion of the cash proceeds to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Should we be unable to generate sufficient operating profit and cash flow from our continuing operations in the future, our liquidity will be adversely impacted as the funds provided by the IHFC sale transaction are exhausted.

The risk factors below represent what we believe are the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position or future financial results. We face a volatile retail environment and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending. The home furnishings industry has experienced a difficult period over the last 5 years marked with depressed housing starts, high unemployment, changing consumer confidence and uncertain fiscal policies.  While 2012 showed improvement, considerable economic uncertainty still exists.  Historically, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. Should the current economic recovery falter or the current recovery in housing starts stall, consumer confidence and demand for home furnishings could deteriorate which could adversely affect our business through its impact on the performance of our Company-owned stores, as well as our licensees and the ability of a number of them to meet their obligations to us. Unsuccessful implementation of the HGTV open market strategy and the development of a new furniture brand could be detrimental to future operating results. In September of 2011, we announced the formation of a strategic partnership with HGTV, a division of Scripps Networks, LLC., which combines our 110 year heritage in the furniture industry with the penetration of 99 million households in the United States that HGTV enjoys today.  As part of this alliance, we have developed, in conjunction with HGTV, a new line of furniture that contains only the HGTV® Home Collection brand and will be primarily marketed through select top-100 furniture retailers.  We have incurred significant expense to design and procure the furniture and develop the in-house infrastructure to manage the brand.  Should we not generate the incremental sales necessary to appropriately leverage the additional costs, future operating results could be adversely impacted. Our use of foreign sources of production for a substantial portion of our products exposes us to certain additional risks associated with international operations. Our use of foreign sources for the supply of many of our products exposes us to risks associated with overseas sourcing.  These risks are related to government regulation, delays in shipments, and extended lead time in ordering.

This system implementation may not result in improvements that outweigh its costs and may disrupt our operations. Our inability to mitigate future disruptions could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The risk factors below represent what we believe are the known material risk factors with respect to us and our business. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry, financial position or future financial results. We face a difficult current retail environment and changing economic conditions that may further adversely affect consumer demand and spending. Many industry analysts believe the current home furnishings environment is as difficult as the industry has ever experienced. Historically, the home furnishings industry has been subject to cyclical variations in the general economy and to uncertainty regarding future economic prospects. This historical uncertainty, combined with general economic uncertainty due to lagging consumer confidence and rising unemployment, may continue to cause inconsistent and unpredictable consumer spending habits. Should consumer demand for home furnishings further deteriorate, it could adversely affect our business through its impact on the performance of our Company-owned stores as well as our licensees and the ability of a number of them to meet their obligations to us. Competition from domestic and overseas manufacturers continues to increase and may adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Our wholesale business segment is involved in the development of our brand, which encompasses the design, manufacture, sourcing, sales and distribution of our home furnishings products, and competes with other U.S. and foreign manufacturers and other wholesalers.  Industry globalization and the development of manufacturing capabilities in other countries, particularly within Asia, has led to increased competitive pressures brought about by the increasing volume of imported finished goods and components, particularly for case good products. The increase in overseas production capacity in recent years has created over-capacity for many foreign and U.S. manufacturers, including us, which has led to industry-wide plant consolidation in the U.S. In addition, because many foreign manufacturers are able to maintain substantially lower production costs, including the cost of labor and overhead, imported product is capable of being sold at a lower price to consumers, which, in turn, has led to additional industry-wide price deflation. Our use of foreign sources of production for a substantial portion of our products exposes us to certain additional risks associated with international operations. Our use of foreign sources for the supply of many of our products exposes us to risks associated with overseas sourcing.  These risks are related to government regulation, delays in shipments, and extended lead time in ordering. Governments in the foreign countries where we source our products may change their laws, regulations and policies, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, investments, taxation and exchange controls which could make it more difficult to service our customers resulting in an adverse effect on our earnings.  Shipping delays and extended order lead times may adversely affect our ability to respond to sudden changes in demand, resulting in the purchase of excess inventory in the face of declining demand, or lost sales due to insufficient inventory in the face of increasing demand, either of which would also have an adverse effect on our earnings or liquidity. Our company-owned stores may not achieve the anticipated growth and profitability. Our Company-owned stores currently operate at a loss.  Our goal is to operate these stores at a level of modest profitability to enhance operating margins generated by our wholesale operation.  To be successful, we need to increase our sales per store while decreasing the support costs as a percentage of sales.  As part of our strategy, we must hire, train and retain a qualified staff of design consultants to improve the customer experience.  Competition with other furniture retailers for qualified design consultants also continues to increase. We also compete with other retailers for management personnel and appropriate retail locations. Failures and delays in implementing our retail strategies or failure to realize the benefits of these strategies could adversely impact our business and operating results. Our licensee-owned stores may not be able to meet their obligations to us. We have a significant amount of accounts receivable from our network of licensee-owned stores.  We also own some of the real estate that is leased to our licensees and guarantee some of the leases of some of our licensees.  If these stores do not generate the necessary level of sales and profits, they may not be able to fulfill their obligations to us resulting in additional bad debt expenses and real estate related losses.   6   Unsuccessful implementation of our new store design, or failure to realize the intended benefits of the new design, may be detrimental to future operating results and financial condition. In 2007, we unveiled a new store prototype that we believe is critical to our retail success.  Utilizing the basic tenants of our new prototype as a guideline, we are in the midst of a visual standardization program that will ultimately permeate our entire fleet of stores.  Implementation will occur in stages over the next few years, depending on the availability of capital.  Failure to successfully implement the new store design and/or the visual standardization program, or to realize the intended benefits thereof, could prove costly and could adversely impact our operating results and financial condition. Failure to successfully anticipate or respond to changes in consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Sales of our furniture are dependent upon consumer acceptance of our designs, styles, quality and price. As with all retailers, our business is susceptible to changes in consumer tastes and trends. We attempt to monitor changes in consumer tastes and home design trends through attendance at international industry events and fashion shows, internal marketing research, and communication with our retailers and design consultants who provide valuable input on consumer tendencies.  However, such tastes and trends can change rapidly and any delay or failure to anticipate or respond to changing consumer tastes and trends in a timely manner could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. Our success depends upon our brand, marketing and advertising efforts and pricing strategies, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, or if we are not successful in these efforts and strategies, our business and operating results could be adversely affected. Maintaining and enhancing our brand is critical to our ability to expand our base of customers and drive increased traffic at both Company-owned and licensee-owned stores.  Our advertising and marketing campaign utilizes television, direct mail, catalogs, newspapers, magazines, radio and the internet in an effort to maintain and enhance our existing brand equity. We cannot provide assurance that our marketing, advertising and other efforts to promote and maintain awareness of our brand will not require us to incur substantial costs. If these efforts are unsuccessful or we incur substantial costs in connection with these efforts, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. Manufacturing realignments could result in a decrease in our near-term earnings. We regularly review and evaluate our domestic manufacturing operations and offshore (import) sourcing capabilities.  As a result, we sometimes realign those operations and capabilities and institute cost savings programs. These programs can include the consolidation and integration of facilities, functions, systems and procedures.  We also may shift certain products from domestic manufacturing to offshore sourcing. These realignments and cost savings programs generally involve some initial cost and can result in decreases in our near-term earnings until we achieve the expected cost reductions.  Failure to accomplish these actions as quickly as planned, or failure to fully achieve the expected cost reductions, could adversely impact our operating results and financial conditions. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or cause production delays which might result in a decline in sales, either of which could adversely impact our earnings. We use various types of wood, foam, fibers, fabrics, leathers, and other raw materials in manufacturing our furniture. Certain of our raw materials, including fabrics, are purchased both abroad and domestically. Fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of raw materials could result in increased costs or a delay in manufacturing our products, which in turn could result in a delay in delivering products to our customers. For example, lumber prices fluctuate over time based on factors such as weather and demand, which in turn impact availability. Production delays or upward trends in raw material prices could result in lower sales or margins, thereby adversely impacting our earnings. In addition, certain suppliers may require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to produce products in the quantities we desire. This long lead time may require us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale, thereby exposing us to risks relating to shifts in consumer demand and trends, and any further downturn in the U.S. economy.   7   "
