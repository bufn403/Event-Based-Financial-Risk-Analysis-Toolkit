Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of key known factors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. They should be considered carefully, together with the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report, and with our other filings with the SEC. The realization of any of these risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, growth and future prospects, as well as our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives.Risks Related to our BusinessAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change and hurricanes and tropical storms, particularly because our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida, could impose significant costs and losses on our business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Fresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with higher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Citrus groves are subject to damage from frost and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the recent past, including the freeze in the last week of January 2022. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or killed. These factors can 10Table of Contentsincrease costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida, with our groves located in parcels in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could materially affect our citrus operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. For instance, recent Hurricane Ian had a material adverse effect on the fruit production from our trees for the 2023 harvest season and, potentially to a lesser extent, the next season and future seasons. We seek to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but a significant portion of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes (such as the freeze in the last week of January 2022), unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or properties.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including, but not limited to, citrus greening and citrus canker, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus groves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves.Citrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to humans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions of citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees have become infected. Primarily, as a result of citrus greening, orange production in the state of Florida has continued to drop.Citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium which is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for citrus canker at present, although some management practices, including the use of copper-based bactericides, can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that currently available technologies will control such disease effectively.Both of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we try to use best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce the significant majority of our annual operating revenues. A significant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.A significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business.Our revenues from our citrus business were 95.7%, 97.5%, and 97.5% of our operating revenues in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our citrus division is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States, and because of the significance of the revenues derived from this business, we are vulnerable to adverse events or market conditions affecting our citrus business, in particular, or the citrus business, generally, which could have a significant adversely impact on our overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our failure to effectively perform grove management services, or to effectively manage an expanded portfolio of groves, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If we are unable to effectively perform grove management services for both our own groves and the groves owned by third parties at the level and/or the cost that we expect, or if we were to fail to allocate sufficient resources to meet the grove management of our own groves and the groves owned by these third parties, it could adversely affect our performance and reputation. Our ability to perform the grove management services has in the past and will continue to be affected by various factors, including, among other things, our ability to maintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel, the ability of the independent contractors whom we engage to assist in providing these services to maintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel, and the number of acres and groves that we will manage. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into our organization or that the independent contractors whom we engage to assist in providing these services will continue to be 11Table of Contentssuccessful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into their respective organizations. Our business is highly competitive, and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current market share.Many companies compete in our different businesses and offer products that are similar to our products or are direct competitors to our products. We face strong competition from these and other companies engaged in the agricultural product business.Important factors with respect to our competitors include the following:•Some of our competitors may have greater operating flexibility and, in certain cases, this may permit them to respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry.•We cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or whether those actions will have a negative effect on us.•Our competitors may have access to substantially greater financial resources, deeper management and agricultural resources, regional, national or global areas that offer agricultural advantages, and enhanced public visibility or reputations.There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our present and future competitors, and our ability to compete could be materially adversely affected by our debt levels and debt service requirements.We depend on our relationship with Tropicana and Tropicana’s relationship with certain third parties for a significant portion of our business. Any disruption in these relationships could harm our revenue. Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows.Our contracts with Tropicana accounted for 81.3%, 79.7%, and 77.5% of our revenues in the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The revenue for Tropicana is primarily generated from two contracts. Should there be any change in our current relationship structure, whereby they do not buy our oranges, we would need to find replacement buyers to purchase our remaining crop, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, with the sale of a majority ownership of Tropicana by PepsiCo to a French private equity firm (the “Firm”), there is some heightened risk and uncertainty in our current relationship with Tropicana, which potentially could result in a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows if that relationship were to be changed. We currently have citrus supply contracts with Tropicana that expire in both 2024 and 2025, with the majority expiring in 2024. If Tropicana were to reduce the volume of oranges purchased from us and/or purchased from owners of groves that we manage, we would need to find, and/or the owners of groves that we manage would need to find or work with us to find, replacement buyers to purchase any remaining crop of our and/or of the owners of the groves we manage, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana for us and/or for the owners of the groves we manage may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.Agricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues, with citrus being the largest portion and subject to supply and demand pricing. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Nielsen data, consumer demand for orange juice had decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade; however, we have been able to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. In addition, there is currently a shortage of orange juice worldwide that is forecasted to continue for the foreseeable future. Although the demand for orange juice has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain as to whether such increased demand can be maintained, whether we will see a return to a decline in the future and whether, if there were to be such a decline, the impact could be again offset by higher prices. Although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing, we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some instances, the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic market conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations.If we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These 12Table of Contentsstrategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result, and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues. In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There can be no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.The sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. We are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered or fully covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our product liability insurance coverage.Our agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.Our operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for the use of underground and surface water which are believed to be adequate for our agricultural needs.Surface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water, even though the use of water has been permitted by the State of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of surface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Changes in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops.We engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws. Immigration reform and enforcement has been attracting significant attention from the U.S. Government, with enforcement operations taking place across the country, resulting in arrests and detentions of unauthorized workers. It remains unclear how the U.S. administration and U.S. Congress will approach immigration reform and enforcement. If new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S. and/or if enforcement actions are taken against available personnel, such legislation and/or enforcement activities may contain provisions that could significantly reduce the number and availability of workers. Termination of a significant number of personnel who might be found to be unauthorized workers, or the scarcity of other available personnel to harvest our agricultural products, could cause harvesting costs to increase, or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested, which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Harm to our reputation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Maintaining a strong reputation with fruit processors and third-party partners is critical to the success of our business. We devote significant time and resources to training programs, relating to, among other things, ethics, compliance and product safety and quality, as well as sustainability goals, and have published ESG goals (i.e., environmental, social and governance), including relating to environmental impact and sustainability and inclusion and diversity, as part of our ESG strategy. Despite these efforts, we may not be successful in achieving our goals, might provide materially inaccurate information, or might receive negative publicity about the Company, including relating to product safety, quality, efficacy, ESG or similar issues, whether real or perceived, and reputational damage could occur. In addition, our products could face withdrawal, recall or other quality issues, which could lead to decreased demand for our products or services and reputational damage. 13Table of ContentsWidespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of information. Negative publicity, posts or comments about the Company, whether accurate or inaccurate, or disclosure of non-public sensitive information about the Company, could be widely disseminated through the use of social media or in other formats. If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.From time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges under the federal income tax law. It is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest and penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional income taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available. Moreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult, or not possible, for us to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.We may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations, or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.We continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such acquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.These transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.We seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. For example, (i) in the year ended September 30, 2015, we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States; and (ii) in October 2020 we acquired another Florida citrus property. We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain any financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and diversion of management’s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets, which could include the exit from lines of business. For example, in November of 2014, we sold significant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business and, in January of 2018, we sold our breeding herd and no longer engage in cattle operations. Most recently, we sold certain ranch acres to the State of Florida, and because these acres would have been critically important for carrying out our planned dispersed water storage project, we are no longer pursuing permit approval relating to this dispersed water storage project. Such dispositions could (i) result in a potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, (ii) make our business less diversified, and (iii) ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our citrus business is seasonal.Our citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the second and third quarters of our year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of our year, coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year or in future quarters. If our operating revenues in 14Table of Contentsthe second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation, and, in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have greater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from certain foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally-imposed tariff on orange imports. Accordingly, a reduction in the government’s orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations.Our earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market supply and prices and demand for our products.Excess supplies often cause severe price competition in our industry. Growing conditions in various parts of the world, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms, floods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests, are primary factors affecting market prices because of their influence on the supply and quality of product.Fresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after harvest. Many of the items involved in our business, such as oranges, must be sold more quickly than other produce our competitors may produce, such as lemons. As such, our competitors may be able to maintain certain items they produce in inventory for longer periods than we are able to maintain our inventory, which may offer our competitors strategic advantages when they respond to fluctuations in market supply and demand that are not available to us.In addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand and prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that we produce for health or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to develop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand for our products. If excess supplies do exist, this could result in reduced pricing or unusable inventory which could adversely impact our results of operations.Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or climate change. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations, including, but not limited to, increased energy, environmental, and other costs and capital expenditures. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the SEC’s proposed climate-related disclosure rules, if adopted, would require new climate-related disclosures in SEC filings, including certain climate-related metrics and greenhouse gas emissions data, information about climate-related targets and goals, transition plans, if any, and attestation requirements. If adopted, these rules would impose increased compliance costs and could lead to increased litigation risks related to disclosures made pursuant to the rules, either of which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. ESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and damage our reputation.Companies across all industries are facing increasing and evolving scrutiny relating to their ESG policies, initiatives and disclosures from governments, regulators, investors, consumers, employees and other stakeholders. Increased and varied focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices, or due to our focus on ESG practices at all. In particular, certain customers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, and other sustainability concerns. There have also been changing consumer preferences for natural or organic products and ingredients and increased consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of substances present in certain consumer products. Responding to and complying with these preferences, concerns and demands could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased emphasis on ESG matters has resulted in, and may continue to result in, the adoption of laws and regulations, including reporting requirements, which increased regulation will likely lead to increased compliance costs, as well as increased scrutiny regarding our ESG activities and disclosures, which may lead to increased litigation risks. Moreover, while we may create and publish voluntary disclosures regarding ESG matters from time to time, many of the statements in those voluntary disclosures are based on hypothetical expectations and assumptions that may or may not be 15Table of Contentsrepresentative of current or actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events, including the costs associated therewith. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters. Such disclosures may also be at least partially reliant on third-party information that we have not independently verified or cannot be independently verified. If we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations or fail to meet our ESG goals, or meet the evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, fruit processors and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.Increases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.We primarily utilize labor contractors to harvest and deliver our fruit to outside packing facilities. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and other industries. Shortages of labor, particularly as a result of the recent low unemployment rate in the United States, and in Florida in particular, could delay our harvesting or orange processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.We and our labor contractors are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.Increases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and chemical costs, could adversely affect our operating results.Many factors may affect the cost and supply of citrus, including external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, changes in governmental laws and regulations, tariffs, agricultural programs, severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters. Increased costs for products, as we have experienced in this last year, can negatively impact our operating results and there can be no assurance that they will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.We are subject to transportation risks.We depend on third party providers of transportation and have no control over such third parties. An extended interruption in our ability to harvest and haul our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any extended disruption in the distribution of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters or otherwise, we cannot be sure that our insurance would adequately cover all claims and that any efforts to transport our products by alternative means would be successful and done in a timely and cost-effective manner.We benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land.  Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate property tax liabilities.For the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we paid $2,786 thousand, $2,679 thousand, and $2,570 thousand in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were based upon the agricultural use (“Green Belt”) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of $90,481 thousand, $85,159 thousand, and $82,790 thousand for the years ended September 30, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property appraisers of $419,915 thousand, $391,049 thousand, and $467,948 thousand, respectively. Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural classification or calculation of “Green Belt” values or average millage rates could significantly and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.Liability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.Our agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances. We may be deemed liable and have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay significant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Compliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business, which could reduce our profits.We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our 16Table of Contentsownership of real estate property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site’s location, its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and work to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land, make it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us.Our business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in the business lines and segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.Material weaknesses and other control deficiencies relating to our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading price of our securities.Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. Management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and that a material weakness existed. This material weakness resulted in the restatements of our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of changes in equity and related disclosures as of September 30, 2021, and as of the end of each quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 to correct errors relating to the calculation of deferred tax liabilities and make adjustments to the amounts of previously reported deferred tax liabilities and retained earnings. Although this material weakness was remediated, there can be no assurance that we will not identify additional material weaknesses in the future.In future periods, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which in turn could affect the market price of our securities. In addition, perceptions of us among customers, lenders, investors, securities analysts and others could also be adversely affected. Any weaknesses or deficiencies identified in the future could also hurt confidence in our business and the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, and adversely affect our ability to do business with these groups. We can give no assurances that our controls and procedures will be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair and accurate presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC.Any restatements and resulting investigations, legal or administrative proceedings could result in fines, injunctions, orders, and penalties which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.As discussed above, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting resulted in the restatements of our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of changes in equity and related disclosures as of September 30, 2021, and as of the end of each quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020. This restatement and any future restatements, and any investigations, legal or administrative proceedings that could result therefrom, may divert our management’s time and attention and cause us to incur substantial costs. Such investigations can also lead to fines or injunctions or orders with respect to future activities. At this point, we are unable to predict whether the SEC or any other regulatory agencies will commence any investigations or commence legal action in connection with the restatements discussed above. Any such investigations may result in us being subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.Inflation can have a major adverse impact on our citrus operations and there have been significant ongoing inflationary developments in the United States. It is uncertain as to whether these ongoing inflationary pressures will continue, will increase or will be brought under control. Our citrus operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues and high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our citrus lands will continue to adversely affect 17Table of Contentsearnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, in addition to making it difficult to accurately predict revenue, we are unable to pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices. As a result, if market conditions and commodity prices do not enable us to pass along such cost increases, these recent and future inflationary pressures would likely negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position. Macroeconomic conditions, such as rising inflation, the deadly conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, and the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.During the year ended September 30, 2023, we continued to experience inflationary pressure on transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue through 2024. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, as well as responses to such events including sanctions or other restrictive actions, by the United States and/or other countries, the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, increases in fuel prices, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages have impacted, and may continue to impact, transportation and commodity costs and create significant macroeconomic uncertainty. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. The extent to which current macroeconomic conditions will continue to impact our results will depend on future developments, which are uncertain. Potential negative impacts of these uncertain conditions could include, but are not limited to, the following:•Reduction in customer demand for citrus products and decreased consumer spending levels, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations;•Potential disruption of services and deliveries of equipment and supplies on which we rely to produce and deliver our harvested citrus to producers and fulfilling deliveries to production plants, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation;•We may be unable to obtain financing in the current economic environment on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, or at all, which could impair our cash flows and restrict our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives and react to changes in our business or the environment;•There could be increased volatility in our stock price, which could result in the loss of some or all of the value of an investment in the Company; and •Our ability to maintain our workforce during these uncertain times, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.We incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.As a company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, require us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These laws, rules and regulations may continue to increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems and databases or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems and databases. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we develop internally or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.Portions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to track sales and could interrupt other operational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.18Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our IndebtednessWe maintain a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.As of September 30, 2023, we had $129,319 thousand in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities, and an additional availability of $70,030 thousand is available under our working capital and revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, as well as other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs, which will reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants, and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements also contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide funds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur. We intend to use a portion of the proceeds from the sale of 17,229 acres of the Alico Ranch, expected to close between December 2023 and February 2024, to repay variable rate debt. Following completion of this sale, we will have sold substantially all of the Alico Ranch, which is under-productive land.  Land available for sale in the future to raise additional funds consists primarily of productive land, the disposition of which may negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. In addition, there are factors beyond our control that could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various financial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.To service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among others:•Economic and competitive conditions;•Changes in laws and regulations;•Operating difficulties, increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience; and•Delays in implementing any strategic projects.If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. If we are required to take any actions referred to above, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure investors that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.Some of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.Our credit facility and certain of our term loans that we have currently bear interest at variable rates, which will generally change as interest rates change. Currently, we are experiencing, and are expecting to continue to experience, increases in interest on our variable rate term loans. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lenders will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our credit facility and term loans, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to our Common StockThe market price of our common stock may be volatile or decline, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you initially paid for our common stock.The trading price of our common stock could be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment. The following factors, in addition to other factors described in this ”Risk Factors
” section and included elsewhere in this document may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:19Table of Contents•the occurrence of severe weather conditions and other catastrophes;•our operating and financial performance, quarterly or annual earnings relative to similar companies;•publication of research reports or news stories about us, our competitors or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;•the public’s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;•announcements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, business plans or commercial relationships;•any major change in our board of directors or senior management;•additional sales of our common stock by us, our directors, executive officers, or principal shareholders;•adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;•short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions in our common stock;•exposure to capital market risks related to changes in interest rates, realized investment losses, credit spreads, equity prices, foreign exchange rates and performance of insurance- linked investments;•our creditworthiness, financial condition, performance, and prospects;•our dividend policy and whether dividends on our common stock have been, and are likely to be, declared and paid from time to time;•any repurchases by us of any of our outstanding shares of common stock under our share repurchase plan; •perceptions of the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;•regulatory or legal developments;•changes in general market, economic, and political conditions;•terrorism and/or instability, unrest and wars, such as the conflicts involving Ukraine and Russia or Israel and its surrounding regions, and other international conflicts;•conditions or trends in our industry, geographies or customers;•changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and•threatened or actual litigation or government investigations.We may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.We have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock and in December 2022 announced a reduction in our quarterly dividend to $0.05 per common share, from $0.50 per common share. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the future or have sufficient cash surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors’ current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate, and that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors may, at its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends, or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock"
1,ALCO,ALICO INC,2022-12-13,"Risk Factors
Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  The following is a description of key known factors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities.  Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Risks Related to our BusinessAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change, could impose significant costs and losses on our business.Fresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with higher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Citrus groves are subject to damage from frost and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the recent past, including most recently the impact from the freeze in the last week of January 2022. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or killed. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited to citrus greening and citrus canker which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus groves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves.Citrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to humans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions of citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees have become infected. Primarily, as a result of citrus greening, orange production in the State of Florida has continued to drop.Citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium which is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for citrus canker at present although some management practices, including the use of copper-based bactericides, can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that currently available technologies will control such disease effectively.Both of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we try to use best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce the significant majority of our annual operating revenues. A significant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida and the effects of adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida with our groves located in parcels in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could materially 13 affect our citrus operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. For instance, recent Hurricane Ian is expected to have a material adverse effect on the fruit production from our trees for this current harvest season and, potentially to a lesser extent, the next season and future seasons. We seek to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but the majority of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes (such as the freeze in the last week of January 2022), unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or properties.A significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business.Our revenues from our citrus business were approximately 97.5%, 97.5%, and 96.6% of our operating revenues in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our citrus division is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States and because of the significance of the revenues derived from this business, we are more vulnerable to adverse events or market conditions affecting our citrus business, in particular, or the citrus business, generally, which could have a significant adversely impact on our overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our failure to effectively perform grove management functions or to effectively manage an expanded portfolio of groves could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If we are unable to effectively perform grove management services for both our own groves and the groves owned by third parties at the level and/or the cost that we expect, or if we were to fail to allocate sufficient resources to meet the grove management of our own groves and the groves owned by these third parties, it could adversely affect our performance and reputation. Our ability to perform the grove management services will be affected by various factors, including, among other things, our ability to maintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel, the ability of the independent contractors whom we engage to assist in providing these services to maintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel, and the number of acres and groves that we will manage. Increases in the number of acres and groves we are managing have required us to hire a greater number of additional qualified personnel and have required the independent contractors whom we engage to assist in providing these services to maintain a greater number of additional qualified personnel to provide those services. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into our organization or that the independent contractors whom we engage to assist in providing these services will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into their respective organizations. Our business is highly competitive, and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current market share.Many companies compete in our different businesses and offer products that are similar to our products or are direct competitors to our products. We face strong competition from these and other companies engaged in the agricultural product business.Important factors with respect to our competitors include the following:•Some of our competitors may have greater operating flexibility and, in certain cases, this may permit them to respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry.•We cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or whether those actions will have a negative effect on us.•Our competitors may have access to substantially greater financial resources, deeper management and agricultural resources, regional, national or global areas that offer agricultural advantages, and enhanced public visibility or reputations.There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our present and future competitors, and our ability to compete could be materially adversely affected by our debt levels and debt service requirements.We depend on our relationship with Tropicana and Tropicana’s relationship with certain third parties for a significant portion of our business. Any disruption in these relationships could harm our revenue. Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows.The Company's contracts with Tropicana accounted for 79.7%, 77.5%, and 86.9% of the Company's revenues in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The revenue for Tropicana is primarily generated from two contracts. Should there be any change in our current relationship structure, whereby they do not buy our oranges, we would need to find replacement buyers to purchase our remaining crop, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 14 With the sale of a majority of ownership of Tropicana to a French private equity firm, there is some heightened risk and uncertainty in our current relationship with Tropicana, which potentially could result in a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows if that relationship were to be changed as a result.With the sale of a majority ownership of Tropicana by PepsiCo to a French private equity firm (the “Firm”), there is some heightened risk and uncertainty in our current relationship with Tropicana, which potentially could result in a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows if that relationship were to be changed as a result. The Company currently has citrus supply contracts with Tropicana that expire in both 2023 and 2024, with the majority expiring in 2024. If the Firm caused Tropicana to reduce the volume of oranges purchased from us and/or purchased from owners of groves that we manage, we would need to find, and/or the owners of groves that we manage would need to find or work with us to find, replacement buyers to purchase any remaining crop of our and/or of the owners of the groves we manage, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana for us and/or for the owners of the groves we manage may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.Agricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues with citrus being the largest portion and are subject to supply and demand pricing. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Nielsen data, consumer demand for orange juice had decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade; however, we have been able to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. Although the demand for orange juice has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain as to whether such increased demand can be maintained, whether we will see a return to a decline in the future and whether, if there were to be such a decline, the impact could be again offset by higher prices. Although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing, we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some instances, the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic market conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations.If we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These strategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result, and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues. In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There can be no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.The sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered or fully covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance; however, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.Our agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.Our operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, 15 we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for the use of underground and surface water which are believed to be adequate for our agricultural needs.Surface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the state of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of surface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Changes in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops.We engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws. Immigration reform and enforcement has been attracting significant attention from the U.S. Government (particularly in the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress), with enforcement operations taking place across the country, resulting in arrests and detentions of unauthorized workers. It remains unclear how the U.S. administration and U.S. Congress will approach immigration reform and enforcement. However, if new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S. and/or if enforcement actions are taken against available personnel, such legislation and/or enforcement activities may contain provisions that could significantly reduce the number and availability of workers. Termination of a significant number of personnel who might be found to be unauthorized workers or the scarcity of other available personnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our acquisition of additional agricultural assets and other businesses could pose risks.We seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. For example, (i) in fiscal year 2015, we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States, and (ii) in October 2020 we acquired another Florida citrus property. While we expect that our past and future acquisitions will successfully complement our business, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain any financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and diversion of management’s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Dispositions of our assets may adversely affect our future results of operations.We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets which could include the exit from lines of business. For example, in November of 2014, we sold significant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business and, in January of 2018, we sold our breeding herd and no longer engage in cattle operations. Most recently, we sold certain ranch acres to the State of Florida and because these acres would have been critically important for carrying out the Company’s planned dispersed water storage project, the Company is no longer pursuing permit approval relating to this dispersed water storage project. While such dispositions increase the amount of cash available to us, it could also (i) result in a potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, (ii) make our business less diversified and (iii) could ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Harm to the Company’s reputation could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations.Maintaining a strong reputation with fruit processors and third-party partners is critical to the success of the Company’s business. The Company devotes significant time and resources to training programs, relating to, among other things, ethics, compliance and product safety and quality, as well as sustainability goals, and has published ESG goals (i.e., environmental, sustainability and governance), including relating to environmental impact and sustainability and inclusion and diversity, as part of its ESG Strategy. Despite these efforts, the Company may not be successful in achieving its goals, might provide materially inaccurate information, or might receive negative publicity about the Company, including relating to product safety, quality, efficacy, ESG or similar issues, whether real or perceived, and reputational damage could occur. In addition, the Company’s products could face withdrawal, recall or other quality issues, which could lead to decreased demand for the Company’s products or services and reputational damage. 16 Widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of information. Negative publicity, posts or comments about the Company, whether accurate or inaccurate, or disclosure of non-public sensitive information about the Company, could be widely disseminated through the use of social media or in other formats. If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.From time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges under the federal income tax law. It is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest and penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional income taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available. Moreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult or not possible for us to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.We may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.We continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such acquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.These transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.Our citrus business is seasonal.Our citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or in future quarters. If our operating revenues in the second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have greater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from certain foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally imposed tariff on orange imports. Accordingly, a reduction in the government’s orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations.Our earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market supply and prices and demand for our products.Excess supplies often cause severe price competition in our industry. Growing conditions in various parts of the world, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms, floods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests, are primary factors affecting market prices because of their influence on the supply and quality of product.17 Fresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after harvest. Many of the items involved in our business, such as oranges, must be sold more quickly than other produce our competitors may produce, such as lemons. As such, our competitors may be able to maintain certain items they produce in inventory for longer periods than we are able to maintain our inventory which may offer our competitors strategic advantages when they respond to fluctuations in market supply and demand that are not available to us.In addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand and prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that we produce for health or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to develop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand for our products. If excess supplies do exist, this could result in reduced pricing or unusable inventory which could adversely impact our results of operations.Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or climate change. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations, including but not limited to increased energy, environmental, and other costs and capital expenditures. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. ESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and damage our reputation.Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder the Company’s access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of the Company’s ESG practices. In particular, customers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, and other sustainability concerns. There have also been changing consumer preferences for natural or organic products and ingredients and increased consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of substances present in certain consumer products. Responding to and complying with these preferences, concerns and demands could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the Company does not adapt to or comply with new regulations or fails to meet its ESG goals or meet the evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if the Company is perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, fruit processors and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.Increases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.We primarily utilize labor contractors to harvest and deliver our fruit to outside packing facilities. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and other industries. Shortages of labor, particularly as a result of the recent low unemployment rate in the United States and in Florida in particular, could delay our harvesting or orange processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.We and our labor contractors are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.Increases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and chemical costs, could adversely affect our operating results.Many factors may affect the cost and supply of citrus, including external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, changes in governmental laws and regulations, tariffs, agricultural programs, severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters. Increased costs for products, as we have experienced in this last year, can negatively impact our operating results and there can be no assurance that they will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.We are subject to transportation risks.We depend on third party providers of transportation and have no control over such third parties. An extended interruption in our ability to harvest and haul our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any extended disruption in the distribution of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 18 While we believe we are adequately insured and would attempt to transport our products by alternative means if we were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters or otherwise, we cannot be sure that we would be able to do so or be successful in doing so in a timely and cost-effective manner.We benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land.  Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate property tax liabilities. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we paid approximately $2,679,000, $2,570,000, and $2,714,000 in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were based upon the agricultural use (“Green Belt”) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of approximately $85,159,000, $82,790,000, and $87,976,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property appraisers of approximately $391,049,000, $467,948,000, and $463,799,000, respectively. Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural classification or calculation of ""Green Belt"" values or average millage rates could significantly and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.  If the real estate industry weakens or instability of the mortgage industry and commercial real estate financing exists, it could have an adverse effect on our Alico Ranch sales.  If the residential real estate market weakens or instability of the mortgage industry and commercial real estate financing exists, our Alico Ranch sales could be adversely affected. A decrease in property demand might have a negative impact on our ability to sell our Alico Ranch.Liability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.Our agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances. We may be deemed liable and have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay significant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Compliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business which could reduce our profits.We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our ownership of real estate property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site’s location, its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land, make it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us.Our business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in the business lines and segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.  On May 17, 2022, Richard Rallo notified the Company of his decision to resign from his role as the Company’s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer) effective as of May 31, 2022. Mr. Rallo’s decision to resign was for personal reasons to eliminate extensive travel and/or avoid relocation to Florida and was not related to any disagreement with the Company or its independent registered public accountants on any matter relating to the Company’s financial or accounting operations, policies, or practices. Mr. Rallo has agreed to provide consulting services to the Company through December 31, 2022.  19 On September 6, 2022, the Company announced the appointment of Perry G. Del Vecchio, age 55, as the Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer) of the Company, effective as of September 6, 2022. Mr. Del Vecchio is responsible for all corporate finance, treasury and accounting functions of the Company and reports directly to John Kiernan, the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer.  Material weaknesses and other control deficiencies relating to our internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our reported results and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, investor confidence in our business and the trading price of our securities. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements.  Management’s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022 concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and that a material weakness existed.  This material weakness resulted in the restatements of our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of changes in equity and related disclosures as of September 30, 2021, and as of the end of each quarterly period ended June 30, 2022, March 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, March 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020 to correct errors relating to the calculation of deferred tax liabilities and make adjustments to the amounts of previously reported deferred tax liabilities and retained earnings. As described in “Part II—Item 9A—Controls and Procedures,” we began the process of remediating our identified material weakness. Management’s continuing evaluation and work to enhance our internal control over financial reporting has required and will continue to require the dedication of additional resources and management time and expense. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, which in turn could affect the market price of our securities.  In addition, perceptions of us among customers, lenders, investors, securities analysts and others could also be adversely affected.  Current material weakness or any weaknesses or deficiencies identified in the future could also hurt confidence in our business and the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements, and adversely affect our ability to do business with these groups. We can give no assurances that the remediation measures we have begun implementing, or any future measures we may take, will remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future due to our failure to implement and maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting. In addition, even if we are successful in strengthening our controls and procedures, those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities or ensure the fair and accurate presentation of our financial statements included in our periodic reports filed with the SEC. The restatements and any resulting investigations, legal or administrative proceedings could result in fines, injunctions, orders, and penalties which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. The restatements, and any investigations, legal or administrative proceedings that could result therefrom, may divert our management’s time and attention and cause us to incur substantial costs. Such investigations can also lead to fines or injunctions or orders with respect to future activities. At this point, we are unable to predict whether the SEC or any other regulatory agencies will commence any investigations or commence legal action. Any such investigations may result in us being subject to criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, which could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.Inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.Inflation can have a major adverse impact on our citrus operations and there has been significant recent inflationary developments in the United States. It is uncertain as to whether these recent inflationary pressures will continue, will increase or will be brought under control. Our citrus operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues and high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our citrus lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, in addition to making it difficult to accurately predict revenue, we are unable to pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices. As a result, if market conditions and commodity prices do not enable us to pass along such cost increases, these recent and future inflationary pressures would likely negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.  Rising inflation and the deadly conflict in Ukraine could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we continued to experience inflationary pressure on transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue through 2023. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact 20 transportation and commodity costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results.We incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.As a company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, require us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These laws, rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems and databases or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems and databases. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we develop internally or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.Portions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to track sales and could interrupt other operational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to create macroeconomic uncertainty and could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  We are vulnerable to the general economic impacts of pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any emergence of variants for which vaccines may not be effective. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant macroeconomic uncertainty and supply chain constraints. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in the implementation of numerous measures to contain the virus worldwide, which may continue to cause significant disruptions to the US and global economy. The extent to which COVID-19 and related challenges will continue to impact our results will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Potential negative impacts of the pandemic could include, but are not limited to, the following:•Reduction in customer demand for citrus products and decreased consumer spending levels, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations;•Potential disruption of services and deliveries of equipment and supplies on which we rely to produce and deliver our harvested citrus to producers and fulfilling deliveries to production plants, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation;•We may be unable to obtain financing in the current economic environment on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, or at all, which could impair our cash flows and restrict our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives and react to changes in our business or the environment;•There could be increased volatility in our stock price related to the pandemic, which could result in the loss of some or all of the value of an investment in the Company;•Our ability to maintain our workforce during these uncertain times, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations;•Increase in employee absenteeism of employees of the Company and of our independent contractor service providers (such as contracted field workers) due to fear of infection, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations;•Increase in possible lawsuits or regulatory actions due to COVID-19 spread in the workplace which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations;21 •Spread of COVID-19 in our workplace, which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation;•Increase in the possibility of cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks and other security challenges, particularly as attributable to a substantial number of our employees and suppliers working remotely, which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation; and  •Adverse impact on the productivity of management and our employees that are working remotely, including an impact on our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls and our ability to manage complex accounting issues presented by the COVID-19 pandemic which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation. Our business operations could be significantly harmed by natural disasters or global epidemics. Our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters such as pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks or other health crises. An outbreak of avian flu or H1N1 flu in the human population, or another similar health crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic referred to above, could adversely affect economies and financial markets, particularly those in the United States. Moreover, any related disruptions to transportation or the free movement of persons could hamper our operations and force us to close our offices temporarily. The occurrence of any of the foregoing or other natural or man-made disasters could cause damage or disruption to us, our employees, operations, markets and customers, which could result in significant delays in deliveries or substantial shortages of our products and adversely affect our business results of operations, financial condition or prospects.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessWe maintain a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.As of September 30, 2022, we had approximately $106,696,000 in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities and an additional availability of approximately $89,762,000 is available under our working capital and revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, as well as other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs which will reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements also contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide funds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur. In addition, there are factors beyond our control that could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various financial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.To service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial, business, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include among others:•Economic and competitive conditions;•Changes in laws and regulations;•Operating difficulties, increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience; and•Delays in implementing any strategic projects.If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. If we are required to take any actions referred to above, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure investors 22 that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.Some of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.Our credit facility and certain of our term loans that we have currently bear interest at variable rates, which will generally change as interest rates change. Currently, we are experiencing, and are expecting to continue to experience increases in interest on our variable rate term loans. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lenders will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our credit facility and term loans, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to our Common StockWe may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.We have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock and in June 2021 announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per common share, from $0.18 per common share. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the future or have sufficient cash surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors’ current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate, and that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.There can be no assurance that we will resume the repurchase of shares of our common stock.In March 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning March 9, 2017 and continued through March 9, 2019. In May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning May 24, 2017 and continued through May 24, 2019. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, or elimination of, share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price.If we were to conduct another tender offer or engage in an additional share repurchase program, holders of our securities would be subject to certain risks associated with a decrease in the outstanding number of shares of our common stock.In September 2018 the Company announced the commencement of the Tender Offer. During the Tender Offer the Company repurchased an aggregate of 752,234 shares at a price of $34.00 per share aggregating $25,575,956. These shares represented approximately 9.2% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of October 2, 2018. While we have no plans to conduct another tender offer at this time, we may conduct another tender offer or engage in the repurchase of our shares in the future. Stockholders could be adversely affected by a reduction in our “public float,” that is, the number of shares owned by outside stockholders and available for trading in the securities markets, if the Company makes future tender offers or private or open market repurchases of its shares. Although the Company is not currently pursuing a tender offer or repurchase program, there are no assurances that our Board of Directors will not authorize the Company to do so in the future. Engaging in a tender offer or repurchase program in the future could have a negative effect on our share price.23 "
7,ALCO,ALICO INC,2021-12-07,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  The following is a description of key known factors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities.  Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Risks Related to our Business The currently evolving situation related to the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including the emergence of variants for which vaccines may not be effective, may negatively affect our business by causing or contributing to, among other things:  Potential negative impacts of the pandemic include, but are not limited to, the following:  •Reduction in customer demand for citrus products and decreased consumer spending levels, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations; •Potential disruption of services and deliveries of equipment and supplies on which we rely to produce and deliver our harvested citrus to producers and fulfilling deliveries to production plants, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation; •We may be unable to obtain financing in the current economic environment on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, or at all, which could impair our cash flows and restrict our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives and react to changes in our business or the environment; •There could be increased volatility in our stock price related to the pandemic, which could result in the loss of some or all of the value of an investment in the Company;  •Our ability to maintain our workforce during these uncertain times, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations; •Increase in employee absenteeism of employees of the Company and of our independent contractor service providers (such as contracted field workers) due to fear of infection, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations; •Increase in possible lawsuits or regulatory actions due to COVID-19 spread in the workplace which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations; •Spread of COVID-19 in our workplace, which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation; •Increase in the possibility of cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks and other security challenges, particularly as attributable to a substantial number of our employees and suppliers working remotely, which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation; and   •Adverse impact on the productivity of management and our employees that are working remotely, including an impact on our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls and our ability to manage complex accounting issues presented by the COVID-19 pandemic which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation. 12 Our business operations could be affected by government mandates, including the Emergency Temporary Standard (“ETS”) posted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) on November 4, 2021. The ETS requires employers such as the Company to offer up to four hours of additional paid time off, including travel time, per vaccine dose to allow employees to be vaccinated and reasonable time and paid sick leave to recover from side effects experienced after each vaccine dose. As noted above, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals granted an emergency motion to stay the enforcement of the ETS, subject to the resolution of ongoing litigation challenging the constitutionality of the ETS, and, shortly thereafter, OSHA announced it suspended its activities related to the implementation and enforcement of the ETS pending future developments in the litigation. Also, Florida, and other states have passed laws that may conflict with the ETS. For instance, section 381.00317, Florida Statutes, (i) prohibits private-sector employers from implementing a COVID-19 vaccination mandate without providing certain exemptions and (ii) fines employers who improperly discharge employees up to $50,000 per violation. As a company with more than 100 employees, the vaccination and testing requirements will likely be applicable to us and our workforce, and we will be forced to navigate between any conflicts between state and federal law. These requirements could result in increased costs and legal fees. Additionally, our efforts to comply with these mandates, including requiring that some or all of our employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, could result in increased labor attrition and disruption, as well as difficulty securing future labor needs. Similarly, the efforts of our independent contractor service providers to comply with these mandates, including requiring that some or all of their employees be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, could result in them experiencing increased labor attrition and disruption, as well as difficulty securing future labor needs. If we or our independent contractor service providers were to lose employees (such as contracted field workers in the case of our independent contractor service providers) and not be able to replace them, it could adversely affect our business operations. The legality and effects of the ETS and any future mandates by state and federal governmental authorities related to COVID-19 are currently uncertain, and we cannot predict the extent to which it could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or prospects. Our business operations could be significantly harmed by natural disasters or global epidemics.Our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters such as pandemics, epidemics, outbreaks or other health crisis. An outbreak of avian flu or H1N1 flu in the human population, or another similar health crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic referred to above, could adversely affect economies and financial markets, particularly those in the United States. Moreover, any related disruptions to transportation or the free movement of persons could hamper our operations and force us to close our offices temporarily.The occurrence of any of the foregoing or other natural or man-made disasters could cause damage or disruption to us, our employees, operations, markets and customers, which could result in significant delays in deliveries or substantial shortages of our products and adversely affect our business results of operations, financial condition or prospects.Adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change, could impose significant costs and losses on our business.Fresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with higher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Citrus groves are subject to damage from frost and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the recent past, including most recently the impact from Hurricane Irma. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or killed. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited to citrus greening and citrus canker which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus groves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves.Citrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to humans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions of citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees have become infected. Primarily, as a result of citrus greening, orange production in the State of Florida has continued to drop.13 Citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium which is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for citrus canker at present although some management practices, including the use of copper-based bactericides, can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that currently available technologies will control such disease effectively.Both of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we try to use best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce the significant majority of our annual operating revenues. A significant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida and the effects of adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida with our groves located in parcels in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could materially affect our citrus operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. We seek to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but the majority of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or properties.A significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business.Our revenues from our citrus business were approximately 97.5%, 96.6%, and 97.4% of our operating revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our citrus division is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States and because of the significance of the revenues derived from this business, we are more vulnerable to adverse events or market conditions affecting our citrus business, in particular, or the citrus business, generally, which could have a significant adversely impact on our overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our failure to effectively perform grove management functions or to effectively manage an expanded portfolio of groves could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Recently, we have significantly expanded the number of grove acres that we are managing for third parties. If we are unable to effectively perform grove management services for both our own groves and the groves owned by third parties at the level and/or the cost that we expect, or if we were to fail to allocate sufficient resources to meet the grove management of our own groves and the groves owned by these third parties, it could adversely affect our performance and reputation. Our ability to perform the grove management services will be affected by various factors, including, among other things, our ability to maintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel, the ability of the independent contractors whom we engage to assist in providing these services to maintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel, and the number of acres and groves that we will manage. Increases in the number of acres and groves we are managing have required us to hire a greater number of additional qualified personnel and have required the independent contractors whom we engage to assist in providing these services to maintain a greater number of additional qualified personnel to provide those services. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into our organization or that the independent contractors whom we engage to assist in providing these services will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into their respective organizations. Our business is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current market share.Many companies compete in our different businesses and offer products that are similar to our products or are direct competitors to our products. We face strong competition from these and other companies engaged in the agricultural product business.14 Important factors with respect to our competitors include the following: •Some of our competitors may have greater operating flexibility and, in certain cases, this may permit them •to respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry. •We cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or whether those actions will have a negative effect on us. •Our competitors may have access to substantially greater financial resources, deeper management and agricultural resources, regional, national or global areas that offer agricultural advantages, and enhanced public visibility or reputations.There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our present and future competitors, and our ability to compete could be materially adversely affected by our debt levels and debt service requirements.We depend on our relationship with Tropicana and Tropicana’s relationship with certain third parties for a significant portion of our business. Any disruption in these relationships could harm our revenue. Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows.The Company's contracts with Tropicana accounted for 77.5%, 86.9%, and 88.6% of the Company's revenues in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The revenue for Tropicana is primarily generated from two contracts. Should there be any change in our current relationship structure, whereby they do not buy our oranges, we would need to find replacement buyers to purchase our remaining crop, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, the affiliated group of third parties for whom the Company provides grove caretaking and harvest and haul management services sells a significant portion of its crop to Tropicana. If there was a change in that group’s relationship with Tropicana, whereby Tropicana did not buy their oranges, then that group would need to find replacement buyers of its citrus, and, if that group was unable to find replacement buyers, then the group might be challenged in satisfying its obligations to the Company, which might have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.With the sale of a majority of ownership of Tropicana to a French private equity firm, there is some heightened risk and uncertainty in our current relationship with Tropicana, which potentially could result in a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows if that relationship were to be changed as a result.With the sale of a majority ownership of Tropicana by PepsiCo to a French private equity firm (the “Firm”), there is some heightened risk and uncertainty in our current relationship with Tropicana, which potentially could result in a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows if that relationship were to be changed as a result. The Company currently has citrus supply contracts with Tropicana that expire in both 2023 and 2024, with the majority expiring in 2024. If the Firm caused Tropicana to reduce the volume of oranges purchased from us and/or purchased from owners of groves that we manage, we would need to find, and/or the owners of groves that we manage would need to find or work with us to find, replacement buyers to purchase any remaining crop of our and/or of the owners of the groves we manage, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana for us and/or for the owners of the groves we manage may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.Agricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues with citrus being the largest portion and are subject to supply and demand pricing. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Nielsen data, consumer demand for orange juice had decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade; however, we have been able to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. Although the demand for orange juice has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain as to whether such increased demand can be maintained, whether we will see a return to a decline in the future and whether, if there were to be such a decline, the impact could be again offset by higher prices. In particular, although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing, we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some instances, the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic market conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations.15 If we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These strategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result, and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues. In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There can be no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.The sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered or fully covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance; however, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.Our agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.Our operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for the use of underground and surface water which are believed to be adequate for our agricultural needs.Surface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the state of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of surface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Changes in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops.We engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws. Immigration reform and enforcement has been attracting significant attention from the U.S. Government (particularly in the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress), with enforcement operations taking place across the country, resulting in arrests and detentions of unauthorized workers. It remains unclear how the next U.S. administration will approach immigration reform and enforcement. However, if new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S. and/or if enforcement actions are taken against available personnel, such legislation and/or enforcement activities may contain provisions that could significantly reduce the number and availability of workers. Termination of a significant number of personnel who might be found to be unauthorized workers or the scarcity of other available personnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.16 Our acquisition of additional agricultural assets and other businesses could pose risks.We seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. For example, (i) in fiscal year 2015, we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States, and (ii) in October 2020 we acquired another Florida citrus property. While we expect that our past and future acquisitions will successfully complement our business, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain any financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and diversion of management’s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Dispositions of our assets may adversely affect our future results of operations.We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets which could include the exit from lines of business. For example, in November of 2014, we sold significant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business and, in January of 2018, we sold our breeding herd and no longer engage in cattle operations. Most recently, we sold certain ranch acres to the State of Florida and because these acres would have been critically important for carrying out the Company’s planned dispersed water storage project, the Company is no longer pursuing permit approval relating to this dispersed water storage project. While such dispositions increase the amount of cash available to us, it could also (i) result in a potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, (ii) make our business less diversified and (iii) could ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Harm to the Company’s reputation could have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations.Maintaining a strong reputation with fruit processors and third-party partners is critical to the success of the Company’s business. The Company devotes significant time and resources to training programs, relating to, among other things, ethics, compliance and product safety and quality, as well as sustainability goals, and has published ESG goals (i.e., environmental, sustainability and governance), including relating to environmental impact and sustainability and inclusion and diversity, as part of its ESG Strategy. Despite these efforts, the Company may not be successful in achieving its goals, might provide materially inaccurate information, or might receive negative publicity about the Company, including relating to product safety, quality, efficacy, ESG or similar issues, whether real or perceived, and reputational damage could occur. In addition, the Company’s products could face withdrawal, recall or other quality issues, which could lead to decreased demand for the Company’s products or services and reputational damage. Widespread use of social media and networking sites by consumers has greatly increased the accessibility and speed of dissemination of information. Negative publicity, posts or comments about the Company, whether accurate or inaccurate, or disclosure of non-public sensitive information about the Company, could be widely disseminated through the use of social media or in other formats. If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.From time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges under the federal income tax law. It is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest and penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional income taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available. Moreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult or not possible for us to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.We may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.We continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such acquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.17 These transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.Our citrus business is seasonal.Our citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or in future quarters. If our operating revenues in the second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have greater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from certain foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally imposed tariff on orange imports. Accordingly, a reduction in the government’s orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations.Our earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market supply and prices and demand for our products.Excess supplies often cause severe price competition in our industry. Growing conditions in various parts of the world, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms, floods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests, are primary factors affecting market prices because of their influence on the supply and quality of product.Fresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after harvest. Many of the items involved in our business, such as oranges, must be sold more quickly than other produce our competitors may produce, such as lemons. As such, our competitors may be able to maintain certain items they produce in inventory for longer periods than we are able to maintain our inventory which may offer our competitors strategic advantages when they respond to fluctuations in market supply and demand that are not available to us.In addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand and prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that we produce for health or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to develop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand for our products. If excess supplies do exist, this could result in reduced pricing or unusable inventory which could adversely impact our results of operations.Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases or climate change. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations, including but not limited to increased energy, environmental, and other costs and capital expenditures. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. 18 ESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and damage our reputation.Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder the Company’s access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of the Company’s ESG practices. In particular, customers, investors and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, and other sustainability concerns. There have also been changing consumer preferences for natural or organic products and ingredients and increased consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of substances present in certain consumer products. Responding to and complying with these preferences, concerns and demands could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations that could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If the Company does not adapt to or comply with new regulations or fails to meet its ESG goals or meet the evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if the Company is perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, fruit processors and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.Increases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.We primarily utilize labor contractors to harvest and deliver our fruit to outside packing facilities. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and other industries. Shortages of labor, particularly as a result of the recent low unemployment rate in the United States and in Florida in particular, could delay our harvesting or orange processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.We and our labor contractors are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.Increases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and chemical costs, could adversely affect our operating results.Many factors may affect the cost and supply of citrus, including external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, changes in governmental laws and regulations, tariffs, agricultural programs, severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters. Increased costs for products can negatively impact our operating results and there can be no assurance that they will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.We are subject to transportation risks.We depend on third party providers of transportation and have no control over such third parties. An extended interruption in our ability to harvest and haul our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any extended disruption in the distribution of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we believe we are adequately insured and would attempt to transport our products by alternative means if we were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters or otherwise, we cannot be sure that we would be able to do so or be successful in doing so in a timely and cost-effective manner.We benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land.  Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate property tax liabilities.For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we paid approximately $2,570,000, $2,714,000, and $2,755,000 in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were based upon the agricultural use (“Green Belt”) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of approximately $82,790,000, $87,976,000, and $91,312,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property appraisers of approximately $467,948,000, $463,799,000, and $514,330,000, respectively. Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural classification or calculation of ""Green Belt"" values or average millage rates could significantly and adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.Liability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.Our agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances. We may be deemed liable and have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay significant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.19 Compliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business which could reduce our profits.We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our ownership of real estate property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site’s location, its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land, make it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us.Our business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in the business lines and segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected.Our internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed, and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.Inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.Inflation can have a major adverse impact on our citrus operations and there has been significant recent inflationary developments in the United States. It is uncertain as to whether these recent inflationary pressures will continue, will increase or will be brought under control. Our citrus operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues and high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our citrus lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, in addition to making it difficult to accurately predict revenue, we are unable to pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices. As a result, if market conditions and commodity prices do not enable us to pass along such costs increases, these recent and future inflationary pressures would likely negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position. We incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.As a company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, requires us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These laws, rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems and databases or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems and databases. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we develop internally or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be 20 successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.Portions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to track sales and could interrupt other operational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessWe maintain a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately $126,294,000 in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities and an additional availability of approximately $94,664,000 is available under our working capital and revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, as well as other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs which will reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements also contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide funds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur. In addition, there are factors beyond our control that could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various financial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.To service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include among others: •economic and competitive conditions •changes in laws and regulations •operating difficulties, increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience; and •delays in implementing any strategic projectsIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. If we are required to take any actions referred to above, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure investors that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.Some of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.Our credit facility and certain of our term loans that we have currently bear interest at variable rates, which will generally change as interest rates change. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lenders will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our credit facility and term loans, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.21 Risks Related to our Common StockWe may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.We have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock and in June 2021 announced an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per common share, from $0.18 per common share. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the future or have sufficient cash surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors’ current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate, and that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.There can be no assurance that we will resume the repurchase of shares of our common stock.In March 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning March 9, 2017 and continued through March 9, 2019. In May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning May 24, 2017 and continued through May 24, 2019. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, or elimination of, share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price.If we were to conduct another tender offer or engage in an additional share repurchase program, holders of our securities would be subject to certain risks associated with a decrease in the outstanding number of shares of our common stock.In September 2018 the Company announced the commencement of the Tender Offer. During the Tender Offer the Company repurchased an aggregate of 752,234 shares at a price of $34.00 per share aggregating $25,575,956. These shares represented approximately 9.2% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of October 2, 2018. While we have no plans to conduct another tender offer at this time, we may conduct another tender offer or engage in the repurchase of our shares in the future. Stockholders could be adversely affected by a reduction in our “public float,” that is, the number of shares owned by outside stockholders and available for trading in the securities markets, if the Company makes future tender offers or private or open market repurchases of its shares. Although the Company is not currently pursuing a tender offer or repurchase program, there are no assurances that our Board of Directors will not authorize the Company to do so in the future. Engaging in a tender offer or repurchase program in the future could have a negative effect on our share price.22 "
2,ALCO,ALICO INC,2020-12-08,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  The following is a description of key known factors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities.  Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.Risks Related to our BusinessThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic instability and uncertainty and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused economic instability and uncertainty globally and may have a material adverse impact, on our business.   Potential negative impacts of the pandemic include, but are not limited to, the following:  •Reduction in customer demand for citrus products and decreased consumer spending levels, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations; •Potential disruption of services on which we rely to deliver our harvested citrus to producers and fulfilling deliveries to production plants, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation; •We may be unable to obtain financing in the current economic environment on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us, or at all, which could impair our cash flows and restrict our ability to execute on our strategic initiatives and react to changes in our business or the environment; •There could be increased volatility in our stock price related to the pandemic, which could result in the loss of some or all of the value of an investment in the Company;  •Our ability to maintain our workforce during these uncertain times, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations; •Increase in employee absenteeism due to fear of infection, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations; •Increase in possible lawsuits or regulatory actions due to COVID-19 spread in the workplace which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations; •Spread of COVID-19 in our workplace, which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation; •Increase in the possibility of cybersecurity-related events such as COVID-19 themed phishing attacks and other security challenges, particularly as attributable to a substantial number of our employees and suppliers working remotely, which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation; and   •Adverse impact on the productivity of management and our employees that are working remotely, including an impact on our ability to maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls and our ability to manage complex accounting issues presented by the COVID-19 pandemic which could materially and adversely affect our business and reputation. Our business operations could be significantly harmed by natural disasters or global epidemics.Our business could be adversely affected by natural disasters such as epidemics, outbreaks or other health crisis. An outbreak of avian flu or H1N1 flu in the human population, or another similar health crisis, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic referred to above, could adversely affect economies and financial markets, particularly those in the United States. Moreover, any related disruptions to transportation or the free movement of persons could hamper our operations and force us to close our offices temporarily.11 The occurrence of any of the foregoing or other natural or man-made disasters could cause damage or disruption to us, our employees, operations, markets and customers, which could result in significant delays in deliveries or substantial shortages of our products and adversely affect our business results of operations, financial condition or prospects.Adverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change, could impose significant costs and losses on our business.Fresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with higher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Citrus groves are subject to damage from frost and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the recent past, including most recently the impact from Hurricane Irma. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or killed. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited to citrus greening and citrus canker which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus groves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves.Citrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to humans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions of citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees have become infected. Primarily, as a result of citrus greening, orange production in the State of Florida has continued to drop.Citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium which is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for citrus canker at present although some management practices, including the use of copper-based bactericides, can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that currently available technologies will control such disease effectively.Both of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we try to use best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce the significant majority of our annual operating revenues. A significant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida and the effects of adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.Our citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida with our groves located in parcels in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could materially affect our citrus operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. We seek to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but the majority of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or properties.12 A significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business.Our revenues from our citrus business were approximately 96.6%, 97.4%, and 96.1% of our operating revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our citrus division is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States and because of the significance of the revenues derived from this business, we are more vulnerable to adverse events or market conditions affecting our citrus business which could have a significant impact on our overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our failure to effectively perform grove management functions or to effectively manage an expanded portfolio of groves could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Recently, we have significantly expanded the number of grove acres that we are managing for third parties.  If we are unable to effectively perform grove management services for both our own groves and the groves owned by third parties at the level and/or the cost that we expect, or if we were to fail to allocate sufficient resources to meet the grove management of our own groves and the groves owned by these third parties, it could adversely affect our performance and reputation.  Our ability to perform the grove management services will be affected by various factors, including, among other things, our ability to maintain sufficient personnel and retain key personnel and the number of acres and groves that we will manage. Increases in the number of acres and groves we are managing have required us to hire a greater number of additional qualified personnel. No assurance can be made that we will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining skilled personnel or in integrating any new personnel into our organization.Our business is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current market share.Many companies compete in our different businesses and offer products that are similar to our products or are direct competitors to our products. We face strong competition from these and other companies engaged in the agricultural product business.Important factors with respect to our competitors include the following: •Some of our competitors may have greater operating flexibility and, in certain cases, this may permit them •to respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry. •We cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or whether those actions will have a negative effect on us. •Our competitors may have access to substantially greater financial resources, deeper management and agricultural resources, regional, national or global areas that offer agricultural advantages, and enhanced public visibility or reputations.There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our present and future competitors, and our ability to compete could be materially adversely affected by our debt levels and debt service requirements.We depend on our relationship with Tropicana for a significant portion of our business. Any disruption in this relationship could harm our sales. Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows.The Company's contracts with Tropicana accounted for 86.9%, 88.6%, and 86.6% of the Company's revenues in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The revenue for Tropicana is primarily generated from two contracts. Should there be any change in our current relationship structure, whereby they do not buy our oranges, we would need to find replacement buyers to purchase our remaining crop, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Our agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.Agricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues with citrus being the largest portion and are subject to supply and demand pricing. Prior to this current fiscal year, according to Nielsen data, consumer demand for orange juice had decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade; however, we have been able to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. Although the demand for orange juice has increased in this latest year, it is uncertain as to whether such increased demand can be maintained, whether we will see a return to a decline in the future and whether, if there were to be such a decline, the impact could be again offset by higher prices. In particular, although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing, we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some instances, the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which 13 may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic market conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations.If we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These strategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result, and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues. In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There can be no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.The sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered or fully covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance; however, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.Our agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.Our operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for the use of underground and surface water which are believed to be adequate for our agricultural needs.Surface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the state of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of surface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Changes in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops.We engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws. Immigration reform and enforcement has been attracting significant attention from the U.S. Government (particularly in the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress), with enforcement operations taking place across the country, resulting in arrests and detentions of unauthorized workers. It remains unclear how the next U.S. administration will approach immigration reform and enforcement. However, if new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S. and/or if enforcement actions are taken against available personnel, such legislation and/or enforcement activities may contain provisions that could significantly reduce the number and availability of workers. Termination of a significant number of personnel who might be found to be unauthorized workers or the scarcity of other available personnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.14 Our acquisition of additional agricultural assets and other businesses could pose risks.We seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. For example, (i) in fiscal year 2015, we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States, and (ii) in October 2020 we acquired another Florida citrus property. While we expect that our past and future acquisitions will successfully complement our business, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain any financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and diversion of management’s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Dispositions of our assets may adversely affect our future results of operations.We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets which could include the exit from lines of business. For example, in November of 2014, we sold significant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business and, in January of 2018, we sold our breeding herd and no longer engage in cattle operations. Most recently, we sold certain ranch acres to the State of Florida because these acres would have been critically important for carrying out the Company’s planned dispersed water storage project, the Company is no longer are pursuing permit approval relating to this dispersed water storage project. While such dispositions increase the amount of cash available to us, it could also result in a potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, makes our business less diversified and could ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.From time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges under the federal income tax law. It is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest and penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional income taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available. Moreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult or not possible for us to dispose of properties in the future on a tax deferred basis.We may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.We continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such acquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.These transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.Our citrus business is seasonal.Our citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or in 15 future quarters. If our operating revenues in the second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have greater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from certain foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally imposed tariff on orange imports. Accordingly, a reduction in the government’s orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations.Our earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market supply and prices and demand for our products.Excess supplies often cause severe price competition in our industry. Growing conditions in various parts of the world, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms, floods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests, are primary factors affecting market prices because of their influence on the supply and quality of product.Fresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after harvest. Many of the items involved in our business, such as oranges, must be sold more quickly than other produce our competitors may produce, such as lemons. As such, our competitors may be able to maintain certain items they produce in inventory for longer periods than we are able to maintain our inventory which may offer our competitors strategic advantages when they respond to fluctuations in market supply and demand that are not available to us.In addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand and prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that we produce for health or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to develop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand for our products. If excess supplies do exist, this could result in reduced pricing or unusable inventory which could adversely impact our results of operations.Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.Increases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.We primarily utilize labor contractors to harvest and deliver our fruit to outside packing facilities. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and other industries. Shortages of labor, particularly as a result of the recent low unemployment rate in the United States and in Florida in particular, could delay our harvesting or orange processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.We and our labor contractors are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.Increases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and chemical costs, could adversely affect our operating results.Many factors may affect the cost and supply of citrus, including external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, changes in governmental laws and regulations, tariffs, agricultural programs, severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters. Increased costs for products can negatively impact our operating results and there can be no assurance that they will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.We are subject to transportation risks.We depend on third party providers of transportation and have no control over such third parties. An extended interruption in our ability to harvest and haul our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any extended disruption in the distribution of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 16 While we believe we are adequately insured and would attempt to transport our products by alternative means if we were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters or otherwise, we cannot be sure that we would be able to do so or be successful in doing so in a timely and cost-effective manner.We benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land.  Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate property tax liabilities.In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we paid approximately $2,714,000, $2,755,000, and $3,089,000 in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were based upon the agricultural use (“Green Belt”) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of approximately $87,976,000, $91,312,000, and $104,017,000 for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property appraisers of approximately $463,799,000, $514,330,000, and $537,183,000, respectively. Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural classification or calculation of ""Green Belt"" values or average millage rates could significantly impact our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.Liability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.Our agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances. We may be deemed liable and have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay significant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Compliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business which could reduce our profits.We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our ownership of real estate property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site’s location, its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land, make it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us.Our business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in the business lines and segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.Inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.Inflation can have a major impact on our citrus operations. The citrus operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our citrus lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue, just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices.We incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.As a company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, requires us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These laws, rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.17 System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems and databases or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems and databases. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we develop internally or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.Portions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to track sales and could interrupt other operational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessWe maintain a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.As of September 30, 2020, we had approximately $151,000,000 in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities and line of credit and an additional availability of approximately $91,659,000 is available under our revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, as well as other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs which will reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements also contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide funds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur. In addition, there are factors beyond our control that could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various financial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.To service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include among others: •economic and competitive conditions •changes in laws and regulations •operating difficulties, increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience; and •delays in implementing any strategic projectsIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. If we are required to take any actions referred to above, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure investors that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.18 Some of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.Our credit facility and certain of our term loans that we have currently bear interest at variable rates, which will generally change as interest rates change. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lenders will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our credit facility and term loans, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to our Common StockOur common stock has low trading volume and the distribution of all of the shares of our common stock owned by 734 Investors to its members has the effect of increasing the Company’s public float and such increase may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.Although our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, it is thinly traded and our average daily trading volume is low compared to the number of shares of common stock we have outstanding. The low trading volume of our common stock can cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly as well as make it difficult for a shareholder to sell their common shares quickly. As a result of our stock being thinly traded and/or our low stock price, institutional investors might not be interested in owning our common stock, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain future funding, if needed, as well as create a potential market overhang.On November 12, 2019, 734 Investors effected a distribution of all of the shares of our common stock owned by 734 Investors to its members. The distribution of Alico shares of common stock by 734 Investors to its members has the effect of increasing the Company’s public float and such increase, although it may increase the trading volume and thus reduce some of the trading volume risk described above, may at the same time over the short term have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock if too many members of 734 Investors seek to liquidate their shares over a short period. We may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.We have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the future, or have sufficient cash surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors’ current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate and that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.There can be no assurance that we will resume the repurchase of shares of our common stock.In fiscal year 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7,000,000 of the Company’s common stock in two separate authorizations. In March 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning March 9, 2017 and continued through March 9, 2019. In May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning May 24, 2017 and continued through May 24, 2019. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, or elimination of, share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price.If we were to conduct another tender offer or engage in an additional share repurchase program, holders of our securities would be subject to certain risks associated with a decrease in the outstanding number of shares of our common stock.In September 2018 the Company announced the commencement of the Tender Offer. During the Tender Offer the Company repurchased an aggregate of 752,234 shares at a price of $34.00 per share aggregating $25,575,956. These shares represented approximately 9.2% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of October 2, 2018. While we have no plans to conduct another tender offer at this time, we may conduct another tender offer or engage in the repurchase of our shares in the future. Shareholders could be adversely affected by a reduction in our “public float,” that is, the number of shares owned by outside shareholders and available for trading in the securities markets, if the Company makes future tender offers or private or open market repurchases of its shares. Although the Company is not currently pursuing a tender offer or repurchase program, there are no assurances that our Board of Directors will not authorize the Company to do so in the future. Engaging in a tender offer or repurchase program in the future could have a negative effect on our share price.19 "
8,ALCO,ALICO INC,2019-12-05,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  The following is a description of the known factors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities.  Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Risks Related to our BusinessAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change, could impose significant costs and losses on our business.Fresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with higher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Citrus groves are subject to damage from frost and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the recent past, including most recently the impact from Hurricane Irma. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or killed. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited to citrus greening and citrus canker which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus groves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves. Citrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to humans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions of citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees have become infected. Primarily, as a result of citrus greening, orange production in the State of Florida has continued to drop. Citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium which is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for citrus canker at present although some management practices, including the use of copper-based bactericides, can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that currently available technologies will control such disease effectively.     Both of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we use best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce the significant majority of our annual operating revenues. A significant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida and the effects of adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida with our groves located in parcels in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm 7makes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could materially affect our citrus operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. We seek to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but the majority of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or properties.A significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business. Our revenues from our citrus business were approximately 97.4%, 96.1% and 95.1% of our operating revenues in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our citrus division is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States and because of the significance of the revenues derived from this business, we are more vulnerable to adverse events or market conditions affecting our citrus business which could have a significant impact on our overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our business is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will maintain our current market share.Many companies compete in our different businesses and offer products that are similar to our products or are direct competitors to our products. We face strong competition from these and other companies engaged in the agricultural product business.Important factors with respect to our competitors include the following:•Some of our competitors may have greater operating flexibility and, in certain cases, this may permit them•to respond better or more quickly to changes in the industry.•We cannot predict the pricing or promotional actions of our competitors or whether those actions will have a negative effect on us.•Our competitors may have access to substantially greater financial resources, deeper management and agricultural resources, regional, national or global areas that offer agricultural advantages, and enhanced public visibility or reputations.There can be no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with our present and future competitors, and our ability to compete could be materially adversely affected by our debt levels and debt service requirements.We depend on our relationship with Tropicana for a significant portion of our business.  Any disruption in this relationship could harm our sales.  Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction in revenues and cash flows. The Company's contracts with Tropicana accounted for 88.6%, 86.6% and 85.6% of the Company's revenues in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The revenue for Tropicana is primarily generated from two contracts. Should there be any change in our current relationship structure, whereby they do not buy our oranges, we would need to find replacement buyers to purchase our remaining crop, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Our agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.  Agricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues with citrus being the largest portion and are subject to supply and demand pricing. While according to Nielsen data consumer demand for orange juice has decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade, we have been able to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so if demand continues to decline. Although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing, we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some instances the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic market conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations. 8There is no assurance that Alico 2.0 will continue to provide the cost savings that we have achieved. On November 16, 2017, we announced Alico 2.0, which we expect will result in a significant citrus grove cost savings and a decline in Alico Citrus’ general and administrative expenses. While the Company has executed on its Alico 2.0 initiatives and achieved significant grove cost savings, there is no assurance that we can maintain these cost levels. If we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These strategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues.  In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There is no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.The sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance, however, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.Our agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.     Our operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for the use of underground and surface water which are adequate for our agricultural needs. Surface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the state of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of surface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops. We engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws. Immigration reform and enforcement is currently attracting significant attention in the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress, with enforcement operations taking place across the country, resulting in arrests and detentions of unauthorized workers. If new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S. and/or if enforcement actions are taken against available personnel, such legislation and/or enforcement activities may contain provisions 9that could significantly reduce the number and availability of workers. Termination of a significant number of personnel who are found to be unauthorized workers or the scarcity of other available personnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our acquisition of additional agricultural assets and other businesses could pose risks. We seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. For example, in fiscal year 2015 we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States. While we expect that our past and future acquisitions will successfully complement our business, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain any financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and diversion of management’s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Dispositions of our assets may adversely affect our future results of operations.We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets which could include the exit from lines of business.  For example, in November of 2014 we sold significant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business and in January of 2018 we sold our breeding herd and no longer engage in cattle operations. While such dispositions increase the amount of cash available to us, it could also result in a potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, makes our business less diversified and could ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. From time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges. It is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest and penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional income taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available. Moreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult or not possible for us to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis.We may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.We continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such acquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.These transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations 10or the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.Our citrus business is seasonal.Our citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or in future quarters. If our operating revenues in the second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations. We face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have greater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from certain foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally imposed tariff on orange imports. Accordingly, a reduction in the government’s orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations. Our earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market supply and prices and demand for our products.Excess supplies often cause severe price competition in our industry. Growing conditions in various parts of the world, particularly weather conditions such as windstorms, floods, droughts and freezes, as well as diseases and pests, are primary factors affecting market prices because of their influence on the supply and quality of product. Fresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after harvest. Many of the items involved in our business, such as oranges, must be sold more quickly than other produce our competitors may produce, such as lemons. As such, our competitors may be able to maintain certain items they produce in inventory for longer periods than we are able to maintain our inventory which may offer our competitors strategic advantages when they respond to fluctuations in market supply and demand that are not available to us.In addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand and prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products that we produce for health or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to develop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand for our products. If excess supplies do exist, this could result in reduced pricing or unusable inventory which could adversely impact our results of operations.Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. Increases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.We primarily utilize labor contractors to harvest and deliver our fruit to outside packing facilities. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and other industries. Shortages of labor, particularly as a result of the recent low unemployment rate in the United States and in Florida in particular, could delay our harvesting or orange processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.11We and our labor contractors are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.Increases in commodity or raw product costs, such as fuel and chemical costs, could adversely affect our operating results.Many factors may affect the cost and supply of citrus, including external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, changes in governmental laws and regulations, tariffs, agricultural programs, severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters. Increased costs for products can negatively impact our operating results and there can be no assurance that they will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.We are subject to transportation risks.We depend on third party providers of transportation and have no control over such third parties. An extended interruption in our ability to harvest and haul our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any extended disruption in the distribution of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we believe we are adequately insured and would attempt to transport our products by alternative means if we were to experience an interruption due to strike, natural disasters or otherwise, we cannot be sure that we would be able to do so or be successful in doing so in a timely and cost-effective manner.We benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land.  Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate property tax liabilities. In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 we paid approximately $2,755,000, $3,089,000 and $3,106,000 in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were based upon the agricultural use (“Green Belt”) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of approximately $91,312,000, $104,017,000 and $105,496,000  for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property appraisers of approximately $514,330,000, $537,183,000 and $539,790,000, respectively. Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural classification or calculation of ""Green Belt"" values or average millage rates could significantly impact our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.Liability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.     Our agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances. We may be deemed liable and have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay significant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Compliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business which could reduce our profits. We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our ownership of real estate property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site’s location, its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land, make it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us. 12Our business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in the business lines and segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.Inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.Inflation can have a major impact on our citrus operations. The citrus operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our citrus lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue, just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices.We incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.As a company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, requires us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These laws, rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems and databases or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems and databases. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we develop internally or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.Portions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to track sales and could interrupt other operational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessWe maintain a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.As of September 30, 2019, we had approximately $163,000,000 in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities and line of credit and an additional $94,500,000 is available under our revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs which will reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements also contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified 13types of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide funds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur. In addition, there are factors beyond our control that could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various financial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.We may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.To service our debt, we require a significant amount of cash. Our ability to generate cash, make scheduled payments or refinance our obligations depends on our successful financial and operating performance. Our financial and operating performance, cash flow and capital resources depend upon prevailing economic conditions and various financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include among others:•economic and competitive conditions•changes in laws and regulations•operating difficulties, increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience; and•delays in implementing any strategic projectsIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt. If we are required to take any actions referred to above, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we cannot assure investors that we would be able to take any of these actions on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.Some of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.Our credit facility and certain of our term loans that we have currently bear interest at variable rates, which will generally change as interest rates change. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lenders will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our credit facility and term loans, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to our Common StockOur common stock has low trading volume  and the distribution of all of the shares of our common stock owned by 734 Investors to its members has the effect of increasing the Company’s public float and such increase may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Although our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, it is thinly traded and our average daily trading volume is low compared to the number of shares of common stock we have outstanding. The low trading volume of our common stock can cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly as well as make it difficult for a stockholder to sell their common shares quickly. As a result of our stock being thinly traded and/or our low stock price, institutional investors might not be interested in owning our common stock. On November 12, 2019, 734 Investors effected a distribution of all of the shares of our common stock owned by 734 Investors to its members. The distribution of Alico shares of common stock by 734 Investors to its members has the effect of increasing the Company’s public float and such increase may have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain future funding, if needed, as well as create a potential market overhang.We may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.We have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the 14future, or have sufficient cash surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors’ current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate and that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.There can be no assurance that we will resume the repurchase of shares of our common stock.In fiscal year 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7,000,000 of the Company’s common stock in two separate authorizations. In March 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning March 9, 2017 and continued through March 9, 2019. In May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning May 24, 2017 and continued through May 24, 2019. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, or elimination of, share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price.If we were to conduct a tender offer or engage in a share repurchase program, holders of our securities would be subject to certain risks associated with a decrease in the outstanding number of shares of our common stock.In September 2018 the Company announced the commencement of the Tender Offer. During the Tender Offer the Company repurchased an aggregate of 752,234 shares at a price of $34.00 per share aggregating $25,575,956. These shares represented approximately 9.2% of the total number of shares of the Company’s common stock issued and outstanding as of October 2, 2018. While we have no plans to conduct another tender offer at this time, we may conduct another tender offer or engage in the repurchase of our shares in the future. Shareholders could be adversely affected by a reduction in our “public float,” that is, the number of shares owned by outside shareholders and available for trading in the securities markets, if the Company makes future tender offers or private or open market repurchases of its shares. Although the Company is not currently pursuing a tender offer, there are no assurances that our Board of Directors will not authorize the Company to do so in the future. Engaging in a tender offer or repurchase program in the future could have a negative effect on our share price. 15"
3,ALCO,ALICO INC,2018-12-06,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  The following is a description of the known factors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities.  Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Risks Related to our BusinessAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change, could impose significant costs and losses on our business.Fresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with higher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Citrus groves are subject to damage from frost and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the recent past, including most recently the impact from Hurricane Irma. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or killed. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited to citrus greening and citrus canker which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus groves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves. Citrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to humans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions of citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees have become infected. Primarily, as a result of citrus greening, orange production in the State of Florida has continued to drop. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Florida had its smallest orange harvest in 54 years in the 2017-2018 harvest season. The USDA's forecast of approximately 77,000,000 boxes of oranges for the 2018-2019 season is down more than 48.7% from the approximately 150,000,000 boxes during the 2004-05 season when citrus greening was discovered. Citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium which is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for citrus canker at present although some management practices, including the use of copper-based bactericides, can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that currently available technologies will control such disease effectively.     Both of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we use best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce the significant majority of our annual operating revenues. A significant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 8Our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida and the effects of adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida with our groves located in parcels in DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, and Hardee Counties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could materially affect our citrus operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. We seek to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but the majority of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or properties.During September 2017, we experienced significant fruit loss as a result of Hurricane Irma, which negatively impacted both the Company's revenues and earnings for fiscal year 2018, and will most likely negatively impact the Company's revenues and earnings, to a lesser degree, for fiscal year 2019.A significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business. Our revenues from our citrus business were approximately 96.1%, 95.1% and 95.2% of our operating revenues in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our citrus division is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States and because of the significance of the revenues derived from this business, we are more vulnerable to adverse events or market conditions affecting our citrus business which could have a significant impact on our overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We depend on our relationship with Tropicana for a significant portion of our business.  Any disruption in this relationship could harm our sales.  Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction in revenues  and cash flows. The Company's contracts with Tropicana accounted for 86.6%, 85.6% and 32.5% of the Company's revenues in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The revenue for Tropicana is generated among several contracts. Should there be any change in our current relationship structure, whereby they do not buy our oranges, we would need to find replacement buyers to purchase our remaining crop, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Our agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.  Agricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues with citrus being the largest portion and are subject to supply and demand pricing. While according to Nielsen data consumer demand for orange juice has decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade, we have been able to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so if demand continues to decline. Although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing, we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some instances the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic market conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations. We attempt to mitigate these risks by using contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a minimum (“floor”) price and with a price increase (“rise”) if market prices exceed the floor price.There is no assurance that Alico 2.0 will provide the cost savings that we expect, or that we will fully realize the benefits we expect from the program. On November 16, 2017, we announced Alico 2.0, which we expect will result in a significant citrus grove cost savings and a decline in Alico Citrus’ general and administrative expenses. There is no assurance that our Alico 2.0 will provide the cost savings that we expect, or that we will fully realize the benefits we expect from the program. 9If we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These strategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues.  In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There is no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.The sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance, however, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.Our agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.     Our operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for the use of underground and surface water which are adequate for our agricultural needs. Surface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the state of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of surface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops. We engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws. Immigration reform and enforcement is currently attracting significant attention in the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress, with enforcement operations taking place across the country, resulting in arrests and detentions of unauthorized workers. If new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S. and/or if enforcement actions are taken against available personnel, such legislation and/or enforcement activities may contain provisions that could significantly reduce the number and availability of workers. Termination of a significant number of personnel who are found to be unauthorized workers or the scarcity of other available personnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 10Our acquisition of additional agricultural assets and other businesses could pose risks. We seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. For example, in fiscal year 2015 we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States. While we expect that our past and future acquisitions will successfully complement our business, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain any financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and diversion of management’s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Dispositions of our assets may adversely affect our future results of operations.We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets which could include the exit from lines of business.  For example, in November of 2014 we sold significant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business and in January of 2018 we sold our breeding herd and no longer engage in cattle operations. While such dispositions increase the amount of cash available to us, it could also result in a potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, makes our business less diversified and could ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. From time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges. It is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest and penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional income taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available. Moreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult or not possible for us to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis.We may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.We continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such acquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.These transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.11Our citrus business is seasonal.Our citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or in future quarters. If our operating revenues in the second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations. We face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have greater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally imposed tariff on orange imports. Accordingly, a reduction in the government’s orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations. Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. Increases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.We primarily utilize labor contractors to harvest and deliver our fruit to outside packing facilities. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and other industries. Shortages of labor, particularly as a result of the recent low unemployment rate in the United States and in Florida in particular, could delay our harvesting or orange processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.We and our labor contractors are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.We benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land.  Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate property tax liabilities. In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 we paid approximately $3,089,000, $3,106,000 and $3,196,000, respectively, in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were based upon the agricultural use (“Green Belt”) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of approximately $104,017,000, $105,496,000 and $89,922,000 for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property appraisers of approximately $537,183,000, $539,790,000 and $533,617,000, respectively. Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural classification or calculation of ""Green Belt"" values or average millage rates could significantly impact our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.Liability for the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.     Our agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances. We may be deemed liable and have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay 12significant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Compliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business which could reduce our profits. We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our ownership of real estate property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site’s location, its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land, make it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us. Our business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in the business lines and segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.Inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.Inflation can have a major impact on our citrus operations. The citrus operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our citrus lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue, just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices.We incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.As a company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and Nasdaq, requires us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These laws, rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenues, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems and databases or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our systems and databases. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we develop internally or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, distribution or other critical functions.13Portions of our Information Technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to track sales and could interrupt other operational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessWe maintain a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.As of September 30, 2018 we had approximately $177,000,000 in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities and line of credit and an additional $82,000,000 is available under our revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs which will reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements also contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide funds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur. In addition, there are factors beyond our control that could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various financial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.Some of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.Our credit facility and certain of our term loans that we have currently bear interest at variable rates, which will generally change as interest rates change. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lenders will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our credit facility and term loans, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to our Common StockOur largest stockholder has the ability to exert significant influence over our business and its interests may conflict with or differ from the interests of our other stockholders.As of December 3, 2018, 734 Investors, LLC (“734 Investors”) beneficially owns approximately 43.0% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, 734 Investors has the ability to exert significant influence over our business and may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree, including, among other things, delaying or discouraging a change of control of our Company or a potential merger, consolidation, tender offer, takeover or other business combination.We have been advised that, on November 19, 2018, the members of 734 Investors passed a resolution by written consent to remove 734 Agriculture, LLC (“734 Agriculture”) as managing member of 734 Investors, and to designate Arlon Valencia Holdings, LLC as the new managing member of 734 Investors (the ""734 Consent""). On November 20, 2018, 734 Agriculture filed a lawsuit contesting the 734 Consent in the Delaware Court of Chancery (the ""Delaware Court""), captioned 734 Agriculture v. Arlon Valencia Holdings, LLC, C.A. No. 2018-0844-JTL. On December 5, 2018, the Delaware Court entered a stipulated status quo order which provides, among other things, that 734 Agriculture shall serve as the managing member of 734 Investors during the pendency of the Delaware Litigation (as defined below). The status quo order also provides that 734 Agriculture shall not take any actions outside of the ordinary course of business of 734 Investors without the consent of two-thirds of the membership interests of 734 Investors, including exercising any voting rights with respect to any shares of the Company’s common stock beneficially owned by 734 Investors.14Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation at this time, and we can give no assurance that this litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. For more information regarding legal proceedings, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.”The interests of 734 Investors could conflict with or differ from the interests of our other stockholders. Additionally, potential conflicts of interest could exist if we enter into any related party transactions with 734 Investors. Although we are no longer a “Controlled Company” under Nasdaq Listing Rules, we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements during a limited transition period.As of November 19, 2018, we no longer qualify as a “Controlled Company” under Nasdaq listing rules. Although we currently comply with certain of the Nasdaq listing rules applicable to companies that are not Controlled Companies, there are certain exemptions for Controlled Companies that we no longer benefit from, including that the Nasdaq listing rules require that each of the compensation and nominating and governance committees be composed of at least a majority of independent directors within 90 days of the date on which we no longer qualified as a “Controlled Company” and that each such committee be composed entirely of independent directors within one year of such date. During these transition periods, we will continue to qualify for and may continue to utilize the available exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements as permitted by the Nasdaq listing rules. Accordingly, during these transition periods, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements in the Nasdaq listing rules, which could make our common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.Sales of substantial amounts of our outstanding common stock by our largest stockholder could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our largest stockholder, 734 Investors, beneficially owns approximately 43.0% of our outstanding common stock as of December 3, 2018. Our common stock is thinly traded and our common stock prices can fluctuate significantly. As such, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock into the public market by 734 Investors or perceptions that significant sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our common stock has low trading volume. Although our common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Market, it is thinly traded and our average daily trading volume is low compared to the number of shares of common stock we have outstanding. The low trading volume of our common stock can cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly as well as make it difficult for a stockholder to sell their common shares quickly. As a result of our stock being thinly traded and/or our low stock price, institutional investors might not be interested in owning our common stock. We may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.We have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the future, or have sufficient cash surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors’ current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate and that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.There can be no assurance that we will resume the repurchase of shares of our common stock.In fiscal year 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7,000,000 of the Company’s common stock in two separate authorizations. In March 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning March 9, 2017 and continuing through March 9, 2019. In May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning May 24, 2017 and continuing through May 24, 2019. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended from time to time or terminated at any time prior to its expiration. As of June 29, 2018 the Company suspended its stock repurchase activity; however if the Company chooses to resume repurchasing stock it has $1,676,443 available to repurchase 15stock under the 2017 Authorization. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, or elimination of, share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price.16"
10,ALCO,ALICO INC,2017-12-11,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  The following is a description of the known factors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities.  Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Risks Related to our BusinessAdverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other natural conditions, including the effects of climate change, could impose significant costs and losses on our business.Fresh produce is vulnerable to adverse weather conditions, including windstorms, floods, drought and temperature extremes, which are quite common and may occur with higher frequency or be less predictable in the future due to the effects of climate change. Unfavorable growing conditions can reduce both crop size and crop quality. In extreme cases, entire harvests may be lost in some geographic areas. Citrus groves are subject to damage from frost and freezes, and this has happened periodically in the recent past. In some cases, the fruit is damaged or ruined; in the case of extended periods of cold, the trees can also be damaged or killed. These factors can increase costs, decrease revenues and lead to additional charges to earnings, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited to citrus greening and citrus canker which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus groves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves. Citrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to humans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions of citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees have become infected. Primarily, as a result of citrus greening, orange production in the State of Florida has continued to drop. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Florida had its smallest orange harvest in 53 years in the 2016-2017 harvest season. The upcoming 2017-2018 Florida harvest season is expected to decline even further. The USDA's forecast of approximately 50,000,000 boxes of oranges for the 2017-2018 season is down more than 27.2% from the approximately 68,700,000 boxes harvested last season and 66.7% from the approximately 150,000,000 boxes during the 2004-05 season when citrus greening was discovered. Citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium which is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for citrus canker at present although some management practices, including the use of copper-based bactericides, can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that currently available technologies will control such disease effectively.     Both of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we use best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce the significant majority of our annual operating revenues.  A significant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 8Our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida and the effects of adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Our citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida with our groves located in parcels in Alachua, DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, Osceola, Martin and Hardee Counties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops, affect cattle breeding and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could materially affect our citrus and cattle operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. We seek to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but the majority of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or cattle.During September 2017, we experienced significant fruit loss as a result of Hurricane Irma, which will negatively impact both the Company's revenues and earnings for fiscal 2018 and potentially fiscal 2019.A significant portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business. Our revenues from our citrus business were approximately 95.1%, 95.2%, and 95.5% of our operating revenues in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our citrus division is one of the largest citrus producers in the United States and because of the significance of the revenues derived from this business, we are more vulnerable to adverse events or market conditions affecting our citrus business which could have a significant impact on our overall results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We depend on our relationship with Tropicana for a significant portion of our business.  Any disruption in this relationship could harm our sales.  Additionally, if certain criteria are not met under one of our contracts with Tropicana, we could experience a significant reduction in revenues. The Company's contracts with Tropicana accounted for 85.6%, 32.5% and 14.3% of the Company's revenues in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The revenue for Tropicana is generated among several contracts. Under one such contract, if certain criteria are not met, the pricing terms of the contract may be modified whereby we could experience a reduction in revenues.  Should there be any change in our current relationship structure, whereby they do not buy our oranges, we would need to find replacement buyers to purchase our remaining crop, which could take time and expense and may result in less favorable terms of sale. The loss of Tropicana as a customer or significant reduction in business with Tropicana may cause a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Our agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.  Agricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues with citrus being the largest portion and are subject to supply and demand pricing. While according to Nielsen data consumer demand for orange juice has decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade, we have been able to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so if demand continues to decline. Although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing, we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some instances the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic market conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations. We attempt to mitigate these risks by using contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a minimum (“floor”) price and with a price increase (“rise”) if market prices exceed the floor price.There is no assurance that Alico 2.0 will provide the cost savings that we expect, or that we will fully realize the benefits we expect from the program. On November 16, 2017, we announced Alico 2.0, which we expect will result in a significant citrus grove cost savings and a decline in Alico Citrus’ general and administrative expenses. There is no assurance that our Alico 2.0 will provide the cost savings that we expect, or that we will fully realize the benefits we expect from the program. 9If we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.Our success is dependent, in part, on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These strategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues.   In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There is no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.The sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance, however, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.Our agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.     Our operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for the use of underground and surface water which are adequate for our agricultural needs. Surface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the state of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of surface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops. We engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws. Immigration reform and enforcement is currently attracting significant attention in the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress. If new immigration legislation is enacted in the U.S such legislation may contain provisions that could significantly reduce the number and availability of workers. The scarcity of available personnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.10Our acquisition of additional agricultural assets and other businesses could pose risks. We seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. For example, in fiscal year 2015 we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States. While we expect that our acquisitions will successfully complement our business, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain any financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and diversion of management’s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition, and cash flows.Dispositions of our assets may adversely affect our future results of operations.We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets which could include the exit from lines of business.  For example, in November of 2014 we sold significant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business. While such dispositions increase the amount of cash available to us, it could also result in a potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, makes our business less diversified and could ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. From time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges. It is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest and penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional property taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available. Moreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult or not possible for us to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis.We may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.We continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such acquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in the Company or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.These transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.11Our citrus business is seasonal.Our citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or in future quarters. If our operating revenues in the second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations. We face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have greater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally imposed tariff on orange imports. A change in the government’s reduction in the orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations. Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. Increases in labor, personnel and benefits costs could adversely affect our operating results.We primarily utilize labor contractors to grow, harvest and deliver our fruit to our orange packing house or outside packing facilities. We utilize a combination of employees and labor contractors to process our oranges in our orange packing facility. Our employees and contractors are in demand by other agribusinesses and other industries. Shortages of labor could delay our harvesting or orange processing activities or could result in increases in labor costs.We and our labor contractors are subject to government mandated wage and benefit laws and regulations. In addition, current or future federal or state healthcare legislation and regulation, including the Affordable Care Act, may increase our medical costs or the medical costs of our labor contractors that could be passed on to us.We benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land.  Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate tax liabilities. In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we paid approximately $3,106,000, $3,196,000, and $4,054,000, respectively, in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were based upon the agricultural use (“Green Belt”) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of approximately $105,496,000, $89,922,000, and $123,617,000 for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property appraisers of approximately $539,790,000, $533,617,000, and $652,891,000, respectively. Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural classification or calculation of ""Green Belt"" values or average millage rates could significantly impact our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial position.Liability for the use of pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.     Our agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances. We may be deemed liable and have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay 12significant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Compliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business which could reduce our profits. We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our ownership of real estate property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site’s location, its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land, make it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us. Our business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in the business lines and segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.Inflation can have a significant adverse effect on our operations.Inflation can have a major impact on our citrus operations. The citrus operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues and very high irrigation water costs. High fixed water costs related to our citrus lands will continue to adversely affect earnings. Prices received for many of our products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices. Therefore, it is difficult for us to accurately predict revenue, just as we cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation, except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices.We incur increased costs as a result of being a publicly traded company.As a Company with publicly traded securities, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant legal, accounting and other expenses. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules promulgated by the SEC and NASDAQ, requires us to adopt corporate governance practices applicable to U.S. public companies. These rules and regulations may increase our legal and financial compliance costs, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. Computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including “bugs” and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, packing, distribution or other critical functions.Portions of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and 13resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to track sales and could interrupt other operational or financial processes, which in turn could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessWe maintain a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.As of September 30, 2017 we had approximately $186,000,000 in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities and an additional $85,000,000 is available under our revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs which will reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements also contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide funds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur and there are factors beyond our control that could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various financial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.Some of our debt is based on variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expenses in the event of an increase in the interest rates.Our Credit Facility and certain of our term loans that we have currently bear interest at variable rates, which will generally change as interest rates change. We bear the risk that the rates we are charged by our lenders will increase faster than the earnings and cash flow of our business, which could reduce profitability, adversely affect our ability to service our debt, cause us to breach covenants contained in our Credit Facility and Term Loans, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Risks Related to our Common StockOur largest stockholder has effective control over the election of our Board of Directors and other matters. 734 Investors, LLC (""734 Investors"") and its two controlling persons, Remy W. Trafelet and George Brokaw, together beneficially own approximately 59.5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 7, 2017. Accordingly, by virtue of its ownership percentage, 734 Investors is able to elect all of our directors and officers, and has the ability to exert significant influence over our business and may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree, including, among other things, changes in our business plan, delaying, discouraging or preventing a change of control of our Company or a potential merger, consolidation, tender offer, takeover or other business combination. Additionally, potential conflicts of interest could exist when we enter into related party transactions with 734 Investors such as the Silver Nip Citrus merger we entered into on February 28, 2015.  The terms of the merger were negotiated and considered by a special committee comprised entirely of independent and disinterested members of our Board of Directors.We are a “Controlled Company” under the NASDAQ Listing Rules and therefore are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, which could reduce the influence of independent directors.We are a “Controlled Company” under NASDAQ listing rules, because more than 50% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock is controlled by 734 Investors and its two controlling persons, Remy W. Trafelet and George Brokaw. As a consequence, we are exempt from certain NASDAQ requirements including the requirement that: •Our Board of Directors be composed of a majority of independent directors;•The compensation of our officers be determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and14•Nominations to the Board of Directors be made by a majority of the independent directors or a nominations committee composed solely of independent directors.However, NASDAQ does require that our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. In addition, Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) requires that a compensation committee of outside directors (within the meaning of Section 162(m)) approve stock option grants to executive officers in order for us to be able to claim deductions for the compensation expense attributable to such stock options. Notwithstanding the foregoing exemptions, we do have a majority of independent directors on our Board of Directors and we do have an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee composed primarily of independent directors.Although we currently comply with certain of the NASDAQ listing rules that do not apply to controlled companies, our compliance is voluntary, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply with these standards in the future. If in the future our Board of Directors elects to rely on the exemptions permitted by the NASDAQ listing standards and reduce the number or proportion of independent directors on our Board and its committees, the influence of independent directors would be reduced.Sales of substantial amounts of our outstanding common stock by our largest stockholder could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our largest stockholder, 734 Investors, beneficially owns approximately 59.5% of our outstanding common stock as of December 7, 2017. Our common stock is thinly traded and our common stock prices can fluctuate significantly. As such, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock into the public market by 734 Investors or perceptions that significant sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our common stock has low trading volume. Although our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Market, it is thinly traded and our average daily trading volume is low compared to the number of shares of common stock we have outstanding. The low trading volume of our common stock can cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly as well as make it difficult for you to sell your common shares quickly. As a result of our stock being thinly traded and/or our low stock price, institutional investors might not be interested in owning our common stock. We may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.We have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the future, or have sufficient cash surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors’ current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate and that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.There can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock.In fiscal year 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7,000,000 of the Company’s common stock in two separate authorizations. In March 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $5,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning March 9, 2017 and continuing through March 9, 2019. In May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2,000,000 of the Company’s common stock beginning May 24, 2017 and continuing through May 24, 2019. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended from time to time or terminated at any time prior to its expiration. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, or elimination of, share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price.15"
11,ALCO,ALICO INC,2016-12-06,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
 Our business and results of operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control.  The following is a description of the known factors that we believe may materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  They should be considered carefully, in addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, including the related Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities.  Additional risks or uncertainties that are not currently known to us that we currently deem to be immaterial or that could apply to any company could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Risks related to our BusinessOur citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited to citrus greening and citrus canker which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as citrus greening and citrus canker. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in our citrus groves and in the areas where our citrus groves are located. The success of our citrus business is directly related to the viability and health of our citrus groves. Citrus greening is one of the most serious citrus plant diseases in the world. Once a tree is infected, its productivity generally decreases. While the disease poses no threat to humans or animals, it has devastated citrus crops throughout the United States and abroad. Named for its green, misshapen fruit, citrus greening disease has now killed millions of citrus plants in the southeastern United States and has spread across the entire country. Infected trees produce fruits that are green, misshapen and bitter, unsuitable for sale as fresh fruit or for juice. Infected trees can die within a few years. At the present time, there is no known cure for citrus greening once trees are infected. Primarily as a result of citrus greening, orange production in the State of Florida has continued 6to drop and according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Florida had its smallest orange harvest in 52 years in the 2015-2016 harvest season. The upcoming 2016-2017 Florida harvest season is expected to decline even further. The USDA's forecast of approximately 72,000,000 boxes of oranges for the 2016-2017 season is down more than 13 percent from the approximately 81,600,000 boxes harvested last season and represents a decline of more than 52 percent since the time citrus greening was discovered at approximately 150,000,000 boxes during the 2004-05 season.Citrus canker is a disease affecting citrus species and is caused by a bacterium and is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for citrus canker at the present time although some management practices including the use of copper-based bactericides can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that available technologies to control such disease will be effective.     Both of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida citrus industry and to our citrus groves. While we use best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their spread, there can be no assurance that our mitigation efforts will be successful. These diseases can significantly increase our costs which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our citrus groves produce a significant majority of our annual operating revenues and a significant reduction in available citrus from our citrus groves could decrease our operating revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable. Agricultural operations traditionally provide almost all of our operating revenues with citrus being the largest portion and are subject to supply and demand pricing. While according to Nielsen data consumer demand for orange juice has decreased significantly to its lowest level in almost a decade, we have been able to offset the impact of such decline with higher prices based on a lower supply of available oranges. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so if demand continues to decline. Although our processed citrus is subject to minimum pricing we are unable to predict with certainty the final price we will receive for our products. In some instances the harvest and growth cycle will dictate when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Limited supply of certain agricultural commodities due to world and domestic market conditions can cause commodity prices to rise in certain situations. We attempt to mitigate these risks by using contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a minimum (“floor”) price and with a price increase (“rise”) if market prices exceed the floor price. As a result, our profitability may be subject to significant variability. Our citrus groves are geographically concentrated in Florida and the effects of adverse weather conditions including hurricanes and tropical storms could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position. Our citrus operations are concentrated in central and south Florida with our groves located in parcels in Alachua, DeSoto, Polk, Collier, Hendry, Charlotte, Highlands, Osceola, Martin and Hardee Counties. Because our groves are located in close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to our results of operations. Florida is particularly susceptible to the occurrence of hurricanes and tropical storms. Depending on where any particular hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall, our properties could experience significant, if not catastrophic damage. Hurricanes and tropical storms have the potential to destroy crops, affect cattle breeding and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of high winds or through the spread of windblown disease. Such damage could materially affect our citrus and cattle operations and could result in a loss of operating revenues from those products for a multi-year period. We seek to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but the majority of our crops remain uninsured. In addition to hurricanes and tropical storms, the occurrence of other natural disasters and climate conditions in Florida, such as tornadoes, floods, freezes, unusually heavy or prolonged rain, droughts and heat waves, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to realize income from our crops or cattle.A significant and increasing portion of our revenues are derived from our citrus business and any adverse event affecting such business could disproportionately harm our business. Our revenues from our citrus business were approximately 95.2%, 95.5% and 71.9% of our operating revenues in fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a result of our recently announced acquisitions of three Florida citrus properties and the disposition of our sugarcane lands, the percentage of our operating revenues derived from our citrus business has increased significantly. These acquisitions resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States and since we will not be as diversified as we have been previously, we will be more vulnerable to adverse events or market conditions affecting our citrus business which could have a significant impact on our overall business results. 7We maintain a significant amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and may limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business.As of September 30, 2016 we had approximately $197,000,000 in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our secured credit facilities and an additional $80,000,000 is available under our revolving lines of credit. Our loan agreements, and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have negative consequences to us and could limit our business because we will use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay debt service costs which will reduce the funds available to us for corporate and general expenses and it may make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business. Our loan agreements require us to comply with various restrictive covenants and some contain financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios and tests. Our failure to meet these covenants could result in default under these loan agreements and would result in a cross-default under other loan agreements. In the event of a default and our inability to obtain a waiver of the default, all amounts outstanding under loan agreements could be declared immediately due and payable. Our loan agreements also contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. We expect that we will depend primarily upon our citrus operations to provide funds to pay our corporate and general expenses and to pay any amounts that may become due under any credit facilities and any other indebtedness we may incur and there are factors beyond our control that could negatively affect our citrus business revenue stream. Our ability to make these payments depends on our future performance, which will be affected by various financial, business, macroeconomic and other factors, many of which we cannot control.If we are unable to successfully develop and execute our strategic growth initiatives, or if they do not adequately address the challenges or opportunities we face, our business, financial condition and prospects may be adversely affected.Our success is dependent in part on our ability to identify, develop and execute appropriate strategic growth initiatives that will enable us to achieve sustainable growth in the long term. The implementation of our strategic initiatives is subject to both the risks affecting our business generally and the inherent risks associated with implementing new strategies. These strategic initiatives may not be successful in generating revenues or improving operating profit and, if they are, it may take longer than anticipated. As a result and depending on evolving conditions and opportunities, we may need to adjust our strategic initiatives and such changes could be substantial, including modifying or terminating one or more of such initiatives. Termination of such initiatives may require us to write down or write off the value of our investments in them. Transition and changes in our strategic initiatives may also create uncertainty in our employees, customers and partners that could adversely affect our business and revenues.   In addition, we may incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing our strategic initiatives, attempting to attract revenue opportunities or changing our strategies. There is no assurance that the implementation of any strategic growth initiative will be successful, and we may not realize anticipated benefits at levels we project or at all, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects.Our agricultural operations are subject to water use regulations restricting our access to water.     Our operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water is regulated by the state of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits in place for the next 15 to 20 years for the use of underground and surface water which are adequate for our agricultural needs. Surface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and a system of canals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the state of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps of Engineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in availability of surface water use may result during times of drought, because of lower lake levels and could materially adversely affect our agricultural operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our recent acquisitions of three Florida citrus properties and the acquisition of additional agricultural assets and other businesses could pose risks. We seek to opportunistically acquire new agricultural assets from time to time that we believe would complement our business. In fiscal year 2015, we acquired three Florida citrus properties, including Orange-Co and Silver Nip Citrus, which resulted in our citrus division being one of the largest citrus producers in the United States. While we expect that our acquisitions will successfully complement our business, we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, which could reduce our anticipated results. We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, negotiate 8appropriate acquisition terms, or obtain any financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions or complete proposed acquisitions. Acquisitions by us could result in accounting changes, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, increased debt and contingent liabilities, reduce the amount of cash available for dividends, debt service payments, integration issues and diversion of management’s attention, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. We may be unable to successfully realize the financial, operational, and other benefits we anticipate from our acquisitions and our failure to do so could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.Dispositions of our assets may adversely affect our future results of operations.We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain of our assets which could include the exit from lines of business.  For example, in November of 2014 we sold significant sugarcane assets and we are no longer involved in the sugarcane business. While such dispositions increase the amount of cash available to us, it could also result in a potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams that we might not be able to replace, makes our business less diversified and could ultimately have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 Exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis. From time to time we dispose of properties in transactions that are intended to qualify as Section 1031 Exchanges. It is possible that the qualification of a transaction as a Section 1031 Exchange could be successfully challenged and determined to be currently taxable and we could also be required to pay interest and penalties. As a result, we may be required to borrow funds in order to pay additional property taxes, and the payment of such taxes could cause us to have less cash available. Moreover, it is possible that legislation could be enacted that could modify or repeal the laws with respect to Section 1031 Exchanges, which could make it more difficult or not possible for us to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis.We may undertake one or more significant corporate transactions that may not achieve their intended results, may adversely affect our financial condition and our results of operations or result in unforeseeable risks to our business.We continuously evaluate the acquisition or disposition of operating businesses and assets and may in the future undertake one or more significant transactions. Any such acquisitive transaction could be material to our business and could take any number of forms, including mergers, joint ventures and the purchase of equity interests. The consideration for such acquisitive transactions may include, among other things, cash, common stock or equity interests in us or our subsidiaries, or a contribution of property or equipment to obtain equity interests, and in conjunction with a transaction we might incur additional indebtedness. We also routinely evaluate the benefits of disposing of certain assets. Such dispositions could take the form of asset sales, mergers or sales of equity interests.These transactions may present significant risks such as insufficient assets to offset liabilities assumed, potential loss of significant operating revenues and income streams, increased or unexpected expenses, inadequate return of capital, regulatory or compliance issues, the triggering of certain financial covenants in our debt instruments (including accelerated repayment) and unidentified issues not discovered in due diligence. In addition, such transactions could distract management from current operations. As a result of the risks inherent in such transactions, we cannot guarantee that any such transaction will ultimately result in the realization of its anticipated benefits or that it will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we were to complete such an acquisition, disposition, investment or other strategic transaction, we may require additional debt or equity financing that could result in a significant increase in our amount of debt and our debt service obligations or the number of outstanding shares of our common stock, thereby diluting holders of our common stock outstanding prior to such acquisition.We are subject to the risk of product contamination and product liability claims.The sale of agricultural products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that our agricultural products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our insurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product 9liability insurance, however, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage.Changes in immigration laws could impact our ability to harvest our crops. We engage third parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws. The scarcity of available personnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a material adverse effect to our citrus grove business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in demand for our agricultural products can affect demand and pricing of such products. The general public's demand for particular food crops we grow and sell could reduce prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products we produce and we are unable to modify our products or develop products that satisfy new customer preferences, there could be a decrease in prices for our products. Even if market prices are unfavorable, produce items which are ready to be or have been harvested must be brought to market. Additionally, we have significant investments in our citrus groves and cannot easily shift to alternative crops for this land. A decrease in the selling price received for our products due to the factors described above could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our citrus business is seasonal.Our citrus groves produce the majority of our annual operating revenues and the citrus business is seasonal because it is tied to the growing and picking seasons. Historically, the second and third quarters of our fiscal year generally produce the majority of our annual revenues, and our working capital requirements are typically greater in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year coinciding with our planting cycles. Because of the seasonality of our business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year or in future quarters. If our operating revenues in the second and third quarters are lower than expected, it would have a disproportionately large adverse impact on our annual operating results.We face significant competition in our agricultural operations. We face significant competition in our agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and do not have any branded products. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than us. Because foreign growers have greater flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from foreign suppliers of orange juice is mitigated by a governmentally imposed tariff on orange imports. A change in the government’s reduction in the orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results of operations. Climate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.There is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on the productivity of our citrus groves, it could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is enacted, we may experience significant increases in our costs of operations. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations. We benefit from reduced real estate taxes due to the agricultural classification of a majority of our land.  Changes in the classification or valuation methods employed by county property appraisers could cause significant changes in our real estate tax liabilities. In the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014 we paid approximately $3,196,000, $4,054,000 and $2,291,000, respectively, in real estate taxes, respectively. These taxes were based upon the agricultural use (“Green Belt”) values determined by the county property appraisers in which counties we own land, of approximately $89,922,000, $123,617,000 and $74,105,000 for each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which differs significantly from the fair values determined by the county property appraisers of approximately $533,617,000, $652,891,000 and $518,112,000, respectively.  10Changes in state law or county policy regarding the granting of agricultural classification or calculation of Green Belt values or average millage rates could significantly impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.We manage our properties in an attempt to capture their highest and best use and customarily do not sell property until it no longer meets our total return profile.The goal for our land management program is to manage and selectively improve our lands for their most profitable use. We continually evaluate our properties focusing on location, soil capabilities, subsurface composition, topography, transportation and availability of markets for our crops, the climatic characteristics of each of the tracts, long-term capital appreciation and operating income potential. While we are primarily engaged in agricultural activities, when land does not meet our total return profile, we may determine that the property is surplus to our activities and place the property for sale or exchange. Liability for the use of pesticides, herbicides and other potentially hazardous substances could increase our costs.     Our agricultural business involves the use of herbicides, fertilizers and pesticides, some of which may be considered hazardous or toxic substances.  We may be deemed liable and have to pay for the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages, or may not continue to be available at a price or under terms that are satisfactory to us. In such cases, if we are required to pay significant costs or damages, it could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Compliance with applicable environmental laws may substantially increase our costs of doing business which could reduce our profits. We are subject to various laws and regulations relating to the operation of our properties, which are administered by numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies. We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our ownership of real property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the site’s location, its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, we require lessees of our properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may not continue to be available at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land, make it unsuitable for use in what would otherwise be its highest and best use, and/or be significant enough that it would materially adversely affect us. Our business may be adversely affected if we lose key employees.We depend to a large extent on the services of certain key management personnel. These individuals have extensive experience and expertise in our business lines and segments in which they work. The loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We do not maintain key-man life insurance with respect to any of our employees. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled personnel in our business lines and segments.Risks Related to our Common StockOur largest stockholder has effective control over the election of our Board of Directors and other matters. 734 Investors, LLC (""734 Investors"") and its two controlling persons, Remy Trafelet and George Brokaw, together beneficially own approximately 59% of our outstanding common stock as of December 1, 2016. Accordingly, by virtue of its ownership percentage, 734 Investors is able to elect all of our directors and officers, and has the ability to exert significant influence over our business and may make decisions with which other stockholders may disagree, including, among other things, changes in our business plan, delaying, discouraging or preventing a change of control of our Company or a potential merger, consolidation, tender offer, takeover or other business combination. Additionally, potential conflicts of interest could exist when we enter into related party transactions with 734 Investors such as the Silver Nip Citrus merger we entered into on February 28, 2015.  The terms of the merger were negotiated and considered by a special committee comprised entirely of independent and disinterested members of our Board of Directors.11We are a “Controlled Company” under the NASDAQ Listing Rules and therefore are exempt from certain corporate governance requirements, which could reduce the influence of independent directors.We are a “Controlled Company” under NASDAQ listing rules, because more than 50% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock is controlled by 734 Investors and its two controlling persons, Remy Trafelet and George Brokaw. As a consequence, we are exempt from certain NASDAQ requirements including the requirement that: •Our Board of Directors be composed of a majority of independent directors;•The compensation of our officers be determined by a majority of the independent directors or a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors; and•Nominations to the Board of Directors be made by a majority of the independent directors or a nominations committee composed solely of independent directors.However, NASDAQ does require that our independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present. In addition, Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m) requires that a compensation committee of outside directors (within the meaning of Section 162(m)) approve stock option grants to executive officers in order for us to be able to claim deductions for the compensation expense attributable to such stock options. Notwithstanding the foregoing exemptions, we do have a majority of independent directors on our Board of Directors and we do have an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Governance Committee composed primarily of independent directors.Although we currently comply with certain of the NASDAQ listing rules that do not apply to controlled companies, our compliance is voluntary, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to comply with these standards in the future. If in the future our Board of Directors elects to rely on the exemptions permitted by the NASDAQ listing standards and reduce the number or proportion of independent directors on our Board and its committees, the influence of independent directors would be reduced.Sales of substantial amounts of our outstanding common stock by our largest stockholder could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our largest stockholder, 734 Investors, beneficially owns approximately 59% of our outstanding common stock as of December 1, 2016. Our common stock is thinly traded and our common stock prices can fluctuate significantly. As such, sales of substantial amounts of our common stock into the public market by 734 Investors or perceptions that significant sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our common stock has low trading volume. Although our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Market, it is thinly traded and our average daily trading volume is low compared to the number of shares of common stock we have outstanding. The low trading volume of our common stock can cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly as well as make it difficult for you to sell your common shares quickly. As a result of our stock being thinly traded and/or our low stock price, institutional investors might not be interested in owning our common stock. We may not be able to continue to pay or maintain our cash dividends on our common stock and the failure to do so may negatively affect our share price.We have historically paid regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock.  Dividends were reduced beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2014 in order to retain cash which increases our flexibility to reinvest in our business and pursue growth opportunities consistent with our mission. Our ability to pay cash dividends depends on, among other things, our cash flows from operations, our cash requirements, our financial condition, the degree to which we are/or become leveraged, contractual restrictions binding on us, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. There can be no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash from continuing operations in the future, or have sufficient cash surplus or net profits to pay dividends on our common stock. Our dividend policy is based upon our directors’ current assessment of our business and the environment in which we operate and that assessment could change based on business developments (which could, for example, increase our need for capital expenditures) or new growth opportunities. Our Board of Directors may, in its discretion, decrease the level of cash dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of cash dividends. The reduction or elimination of cash dividends may negatively affect the market price of our common stock.12There can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock.In fiscal year 2016, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 50,000 shares of the Company’s common stock beginning February 18, 2016 and continuing through February 17, 2017. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended from time to time or terminated at any time prior to its expiration. There can be no assurance that we will repurchase shares in the future in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in, or elimination of, share repurchases could have a negative effect on our share price"
4,ALCO,ALICO INC,2011-12-14,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.  Ouroperations involve varying degrees of risk and each investor should consider the specific risks and speculative features inherent in and affecting our business before investing in Alico. In considering the following risk and speculative factors, aninvestor should realize that there is a possibility of losing the entire investment.  Our financial condition and results ofoperations could be affected by the risk factors discussed below. These factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements in Item 7. Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The list of risks below is not intended to be all inclusive. Acomplete listing of risks is beyond the scope of this document. However, in contemplating the financial position and results of operations, investors should carefully consider, among other factors, the following risk factors: General  Alico has a 51%stockholder and a limited public float which could adversely affect the price of its stock and restrict the ability of the minority shareholders to have a voice in corporate governance. Atlantic Blue Group, Inc. (Atlanticblue) (formerly Atlantic Blue Trust, Inc.) is the owner of approximately 51% ofAlicos common stock. Accordingly, our common stock is thinly traded and its market price may fluctuate significantly more than stocks with a larger public float. Additionally, by virtue of its ownership percentage, Atlanticblue is able toelect all the directors, appoint all of the officers and management, and, consequently, is considered to control Alico. While Atlanticblue has issued a governance letter dated December 3, 2009 reaffirming its commitment to maintaining amajority of independent directors on Alicos Board of Directors, this commitment may be terminated at any time upon 30 days prior written notice. Alicos Board of Directors and its Committees establish governance procedures andguidelines designed to attract and retain quality directors. Due to the resignations of two directors in 2010, directors independent of Atlanticblue (non-affiliated directors) did not constitute a majority throughout most of the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2010. In October 2010, a fifth non-affiliated director was appointed reestablishing a majority of non-affiliated independent directors. Alico does not have cumulative voting. Accordingly, stockholders of Alico, other thanAtlanticblue, have no effective control over who the management and directors of Alico are or will be.  Alico has drawn significantscrutiny from the Internal Revenue Service  Our tax returns have been subject to frequent examinations by the IRS. Weuse a large national accounting firm to prepare our tax returns, and we review the positions taken on such returns quarterly with our accountants and legal counsel; however, the IRS has taken several positions contrary to ours. The IRS examined ourtax returns for the 2005 through 2007 tax years. The IRS principally challenged (i) Agri-Insurances ability to elect to be treated as a United States taxpayer during the years under examination; and (ii) Alico-Agris ability torecognize income from two real estate sales under the installment method by asserting that Alico-Agri was a dealer in real estate during the years under examination. The IRS claimed additional taxes and penalties due of $31.1 million consisting of$14.5 million in taxes and $16.6 million in penalties but did not quantify the interest on the taxes.  We contested thepositions taken by the IRS and pursued resolution through the IRS Appeals process. On November 22, 2011, we reached an agreement in principle to settle the issues. The settlement provides that Agri-Insurance was eligible to elect to be treatedas a United States taxpayer. No determination was made as to whether Alico or Alico-Agri was a dealer in real estate; however, for the two sales transactions at issue, we agreed to treat one-third of the taxable gain as ordinary income taxable inthe year of sale with the remaining two-thirds treated as capital gain eligible for installment sale treatment. Federal and state taxes and interest due as a result of the settlement are estimated at approximately $0.9 million and $0.7 million,respectively and have been accrued at September 30, 2011. Federal penalties of $15.3 million were considered by Appeals and have been waived. The remaining $1.3 million in penalties have not yet been considered by Appeals to date but waiver ofthese penalties would be consistent with the issues resolved in the settlement. The settlement does not preclude Alico from using the installment sale method with respect to future transactions. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Note 12. IncomeTaxes and Note 18. Subsequent Events in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.   6 Table of ContentsAlico has a large customer that accounts for 28% of revenues. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011, Alicos largest customer accounted for approximately 28% of operating revenue. Ourlargest customer is USSC, to whom we produce sugarcane. Additionally, we sell citrus to Southern Gardens, a wholly owned subsidiary of USSC. While Alico believes that it can replace these arrangements with other marketing alternatives, it may not beable to do so quickly and the results may not be as favorable as the current contracts.  Alico manages its properties in an attempt tocapture its highest and best use and customarily does not sell property until it determines that the property is surplus to its agricultural activities or has greater potential for industrial, commercial or residential use. Alico has little controlover the timing of real estate sales as they are primarily market driven.  The goal for our land management program isto manage and selectively improve our lands for their most profitable use. To this end, we continually evaluate our properties focusing on location, soil capabilities, subsurface composition, topography, transportation, availability of markets forits crops and the climatic characteristics of each of the tracts. While we are primarily engaged in agricultural activities, when land is determined to be better suited for industrial, commercial or residential use, Alico may classify the propertyas surplus to its agricultural activities and place the property for sale. Our land management strategy is thus a long term strategy to acquire, hold and manage land for its best use, selling surplus land at opportune times and in a manner thatwould maximize our profits from such surplus tracts. The timing for when agricultural lands become best suited for industrial, commercial or residential use depends upon a number of factors which are beyond our control such as:     population migration;      national, regional and local economic conditions;      conditions in local real estate markets (e.g., supply of land versus demand);     competition from other available property;      current level or potential availability of roads and utilities;     availability of governmental entitlements;      government regulation and changes in real estate, zoning, land use, environmental or tax laws;     interest rates and the availability of financing, and;     potential liability under environmental and other laws.  Alico is not able to predict when its properties will become best suited for non-agricultural use and has limited ability to influence this process. Additionally, changes from time to time in any or acombination of these factors could result in delays in sales opportunities. Alicos ability to sell tracts which are determined to be surplus or its ability to realize optimum pricing from such sales is therefore uncertain.   7 Table of ContentsAlico is subject to environmental liability by virtue of owning significant holdings of real estateassets.  We face a potential for environmental liability by virtue of our ownership of real property. If hazardoussubstances (including herbicides and pesticides used by us or by any persons leasing our lands) are discovered on or emanating from any of our lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or theenvironment, we may be held strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the sites location, its present and former uses,and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, Alico requireslessees of its properties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. We also purchase insurance for environmental liability when it is available; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs ordamages or may not continue to be available to us at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land or besignificant enough that it would have a materially adverse effect on us.  Significant employee turnover could cause unwanted volatility We have experienced significant turnover in Board and Management positions during the past several years. We seek tomitigate the impacts of turnover by establishing minimum requirements for each position and through the interview process. We attempt to hire qualified personnel and provide competitive compensation, benefit programs and a pleasant workingenvironment to offset this risk. While we believe that we have retained experienced and qualified replacements, interruptions in the development and execution of our business plans, lack of familiarity with the design and execution of surroundinginternal control systems and our operations might cause us to experience difficulties in these areas which could have a material adverse effect.  Agricultural Risks  General  Agricultural operations provide themajority of our operating revenues. Agriculture operations are subject to a wide variety of risks including product pricing due to variations in supply and demand, weather, disease, input costs and product liability. Agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable. Because our agricultural products are commodities with fluctuating market values, we are not able to predict with certainty what prices wewill receive for our products; however, the costs are relatively fixed and the growth cycle of such products in many instances dictates when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessivesupplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices for the commodity affected. Conversely, shortages may cause higher prices. Shortages often result from adverse growing conditions which can reduce the available product in affectedgrowing areas while not affecting others in non-affected growing areas. Alico attempts to mitigate these risks by using contracts with citrus processors that include pricing structures based on a minimum (floor) price and with a priceincrease (rise) if market conditions exceed the floor price. We cannot accurately predict or control what our profits or losses from agricultural operations will be from year-to-year. Alicos agricultural assets are concentrated and the effects of adverse weather conditions such as hurricanes can be magnified. Our agricultural operations are concentrated in counties in south Florida with more than 80% of our agricultural landslocated in a contiguous parcel in Hendry County. All of these areas are subject to occasional periods of drought, flooding and freeze. Crops require water in different quantities at different times during the growth cycle. Accordingly, too much ortoo little water at any given point can adversely impact production. While we attempt to mitigate controllable weather risks through water management and crop selection, our ability to do so is limited. Our operations in south and central Floridaare also subject to the risk of hurricanes. Hurricanes have the potential to destroy crops, affect cattle breeding and impact citrus and sugarcane production through the loss of fruit and destruction of trees and/or plants either as a result of highwinds or through the spread of windblown disease. We were negatively impacted by hurricanes during fiscal years 2005 and 2004 and sustained losses relating to the storms during those two fiscal years. Alico seeks to minimize hurricane risk by thepurchase of insurance contracts, but a portion of our crops remains uninsured. Because our agricultural properties are located in relative close proximity to each other, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be material to Alicosresults of operations.   8 Table of ContentsAlicos agricultural earnings comprise a major portion of its revenues and are subject to widevolatility which could result in breaches of loan covenants.  Borrowing capacity represents a major source of ourworking capital. We currently have a credit facility with Rabo AgriFinance, Inc. that includes a Revolving Line of Credit and a Term Loan. These loans are subject to covenants requiring Alico to maintain a minimum current ratio of 2.0:1, a debtratio no greater than 60%, tangible net worth of at least $80 million, and a minimum debt coverage ratio of 1.15:1. While we currently expect to remain in compliance with these covenants, because of the volatility of our earnings stream and thefactors causing this volatility, we are unable to directly control compliance with these covenants. In March 2010, Alico received a one-time waiver of the debt coverage ratio requirement from its previous lender, Farm Credit of Southwest Florida, inresponse to a freeze which damaged crops and affected the timing of their harvest. We believe that, based on factors currently known, we will continue to remain in compliance with our covenants for the next several years. We negotiated a lessrestrictive debt coverage ratio covenant to provide that the covenant must be breached in two consecutive years in order to be considered an event of default. Nevertheless, due to earnings volatility and factors unknown to us at this time, it ispossible that a loan covenant could be breached, a default occur, and the major portion of our borrowings become due which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Water Use Regulation restricts Alicos access to water for agricultural use. Our agricultural operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water. The availability of water foruse in irrigation is regulated by the State of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which our lands are located. Currently, we have permits for the use of underground and surface waterwhich are adequate for our agricultural needs. Surface water in Hendry County, where much of our agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and the system of canals used to irrigate such land. The ArmyCorps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the State of Florida through the water management district. The Army Corps ofEngineers decided in 2010 to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levee surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changes in permitting forunderground or surface water use during times of drought, because of lower lake levels, may result in shortages of water for agricultural use and could have a materially adverse effect on our agricultural operations and financial results. Alicos citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited to Citrus Canker and Citrus Greening Our citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as Citrus Canker and Citrus Greening. Each ofthese diseases is widespread in Florida and exists in areas where our groves are located. Citrus Canker is spread by contact with infected trees or by windblown transmission. There is no known cure for Citrus Canker at the present time although somemanagement practices can mitigate its spread and lessen its effect on infected trees; however, there is no assurance that available technologies to control such disease will be effective. Citrus Greening decreases the productivity of infected trees and is spread by insects known as Asian Citrus Psyillids. Alico uses apesticide program to control these vectors and an enhanced foliar nutritional program to mitigate the damage to infected trees. At the present time, there is no known cure for Citrus Greening once trees are infected. We use best management practicesto attempt to control diseases and their spread. Both of these diseases pose a significant threat to the Florida Citrus industry and to our citrus groves. We are managing the affects and the spread of these diseases in our groves which, leftunmanaged, could cause a material adverse effect to our citrus grove operations, financial position and results of operations.  Use ofpesticides and herbicides and other materials by Alico or its lessees could create liability for Alico.  Alico and someof the parties to whom we lease land for agricultural purposes use herbicides, pesticides and other hazardous substances in the operation of their businesses. All pesticides and herbicides used by us have been approved for use by the propergovernmental agencies with the hazards attributable to each substance appropriately labeled and described. We maintain policies requiring our employees to apply such chemicals strictly in accordance with the labeling. As a condition of our leasingagreements, we require that third parties also adhere to proper handling and disposal of such   9 Table of Contentsmaterials; however, we do not have full knowledge or control over the chemicals used by third parties who lease our lands for cultivation. It is possible that some of these herbicides andpesticides could be harmful to humans if used improperly or that there may be unknown hazards associated with such chemicals despite any contrary government or manufacturer labels. We might have to pay the costs or damages associated with theimproper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances, which could have a materially adverse effect.  Changesin immigration laws or enforcement of such laws could impact the ability of Alico to harvest its crops.  We engagethird parties to provide personnel for our harvesting operations. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws or by stricter enforcement of such laws. The scarcity of availablepersonnel to harvest our agricultural products could cause harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a materially adverse effect. Changing public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks of Alicos agricultural products can affect demand and pricing ofsuch products.  The general publics perception regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated withparticular food crops we grow and sell could reduce demand and prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products we produce for health or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products ordevelop products that satisfy new customer preferences, there could be decreased demand for our products. Even if market prices are unfavorable, produce items which are ready to be or have been harvested must be brought to market. Additionally, wehave significant investments in our citrus groves and sugarcane fields and cannot easily shift to alternative crops for this land. A decrease in the selling price received for our products due to the factors described above could have a materiallyadverse effect on Alico.  Alico faces significant competition in its agricultural operations. Alico faces significant competition in its agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and does not have any brandedproducts. Foreign growers generally have an equal or lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances, greater resources and market flexibility than Alico. Because foreign growers have great flexibility as to when theyenter the U.S. market, we cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on our business and results of operations. The competition we face from foreign suppliers of sugar and orange juice is mitigated by quota restrictions on sugarimports imposed by the U.S. government and by a governmentally imposed tariff on orange imports. A change in the governments sugar policy allowing more imports or a reduction in the orange juice tariff could adversely impact our results ofoperations.   "

.  Alicos operationsinvolve varying degrees of risk and each investor should consider the specific risks and speculative features inherent in and affecting the business of Alico before investing in Alico. In considering the following risk and speculative factors, aninvestor should realize that there is a possibility of losing his or her entire investment.  Alicos financial condition and results ofoperations could be affected by the risk factors discussed below. These factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements in Managements Discussion and Analysis. The list of risks below is not intended to be all inclusive. A complete listing of risks is beyond the scope of this document. However, incontemplating the financial position and results of operations of Alico, investors should carefully consider, among other factors, the following risk factors:  General  Alico has a 51% stockholder and a limited publicfloat which could adversely affect the price of its stock and restrict the ability of the minority shareholders to have a voice in corporate governance.  Atlantic Blue Group, Inc. (Atlanticblue) (formerly Atlantic Blue Trust, Inc.) is the owner of approximately 51% of Alicos common stock. Accordingly, Alicos common stock is thinlytraded and its market price may fluctuate significantly more than stocks with a larger public float. Additionally by virtue of its ownership percentage, Atlanticblue is able to elect all the directors, appoint all of the officers and management, andconsequently, is deemed to control Alico. While Atlanticblue has issued a governance letter dated December 3, 2009 reaffirming its commitment to maintaining a majority of independent directors on Alicos Board of Directors, this commitmentmay be terminated at any time upon 30 days prior written notice. Alicos Board of Directors and its Committees, establish governance procedures and guidelines designed to attract and retain quality directors. Due to the resignations of twodirectors, directors independent of Atlanticblue (non-affiliated directors) did not constitute a majority throughout most of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010. In October 2010, a fifth non-affiliated director was appointed reestablishinga majority of non-affiliated independent directors. Alico does not have cumulative voting. Accordingly, stockholders of Alico other than Atlanticblue have no effective control over who the management and directors of Alico are or will be. Alico manages its properties in an attempt to capture its highest and best use and customarily does not sell propertyuntil it determines that the property is surplus to its agricultural activities by reason of its potential for industrial, commercial or residential use. Alico has little control over when this occurs as real estate sales are primarily marketdriven.  Alicos goal for its land management program is to manage and selectively improve its lands for their most profitable use. Tothis end, Alico continually evaluates its properties focusing on location, soil capabilities, subsurface composition, topography, transportation, availability of markets for its crops and the climatic characteristics of each of the tracts. WhileAlico is primarily engaged in agricultural activities, when land is determined to be better suited to industrial, commercial or residential use, Alico has classified the property as surplus to its agricultural activities and has placed the propertyfor sale. Alicos land management strategy is thus a long term strategy to acquire, hold and manage land for its best use, selling surplus land at opportune times and in a manner that would maximize Alicos profits from such surplustracts. The timing for when agricultural lands become best suited for industrial, commercial or residential use depends upon a number of factors which are beyond the control of Alico such as:     population migration;   6 Table of Contents    national, regional and local economic conditions;      conditions in local real estate markets (e.g., supply of land versus demand);     competition from other available property;      current level of, or potential availability of roads and utilities;     availability of governmental entitlements;      government regulation and changes in real estate, zoning, land use, environmental or tax laws;     interest rates and the availability of financing, and;     potential liability under environmental and other laws.  Alico is not able to predict when its properties will become best suited for non-agricultural use and has limited ability to influence this process. Additionally, changes from time to time in any or acombination of these factors could result in delays in sales opportunities. Alicos ability to sell tracts which are determined to be surplus or its ability to realize optimum pricing from such sales is thus highly speculative. Alico is subject to environmental liability by virtue of owning significant holdings of real estate assets. Alico faces a potential for environmental liability by virtue of its ownership of real property. If hazardous substances (including herbicides andpesticides used by Alico or by any persons leasing Alicos lands) are discovered on or emanating from any of Alicos lands and the release of such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, Alico may beheld strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition, environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the sites location, its present and former uses, and other factors such asthe presence of wetlands or endangered species on the site. Alicos management monitors environmental legislation and requirements and makes every effort to remain in compliance with such regulations. Furthermore, Alico requires lessees of itsproperties to comply with environmental regulations as a condition of leasing. Alico also purchases insurance when it is available for environmental liability; however, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages ormay not continue to be available to Alico at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possible that in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of a particular tract of land or be significantenough that it would have a materially adverse effect on Alico.  Alico has a large customer that accounts for 23% ofrevenues.  For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, Alicos largest customer accounted for approximately 23% of operatingrevenue. Alicos largest customer is U.S. Sugar Corporation (USSC), for whom Alico grows sugarcane. Additionally, Alico sells citrus to Southern Gardens, a wholly owned subsidiary of USSC. These marketing arrangements involve marketing poolswhich allow the contracting party to market Alicos product in conjunction with the product of other entities in the pool and pay Alico a proportionate share of the resulting revenue from the sale of the entire pooled product. While Alicobelieves that it can replace these arrangements with other marketing alternatives, it may not be able to do so quickly and the results may not be as favorable as the current contracts.   7 Table of ContentsAlico has drawn significant scrutiny from the Internal Revenue Service Alico has been subject to examinations by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for 18 of its last 20 income tax returns. The Company utilizes a largenational accounting firm to prepare its tax returns and reviews the positions taken on such returns quarterly with its accountants and legal counsel; however, the IRS has taken several positions contrary to the Company. During the fiscal years endedSeptember 30, 2008 and August 31, 2007, the Company paid a combined total of $75.7 million in additional federal and state taxes, penalties and interest resulting from to a settlement agreement with the IRS for the tax years 2000 2004. While the Company will be able to utilize a portion of the taxes paid to offset taxes on future property sales, the IRS is currently examining the Companys tax returns for the 2005  2007 tax years. The Company believes that it hastaken the proper positions on the tax returns currently under examination; however, the IRS issued thirty day letters dated September 9, 2010 and October 28, 2010, demanding payment of $22.5 million for taxes and penalties related topositions that the IRS contends were inappropriately taken. These reports propose changes to the Companys tax liabilities for each of these tax years and require the Company either to agree with the changes and remit the specified taxes andpenalties, or to submit a rebuttal. While the IRS notices did not specify interest related to the additional taxes, the Company has estimated potential Federal interest at approximately $4.9 million. If the IRS were to prevail on all of itspositions, it would also result in additional State taxes of $2.5 million and interest of $844 thousand. Alico is appealing the issues contained in these letters and believes that the positions taken by Alico and its subsidiaries were correct;however, an adverse outcome could cause a breach of the Companys loan agreements and have a significant material adverse effect on Alicos operations, financial condition and liquidity. For further information regarding the ongoing IRSexaminations, please refer to Note 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Significant employee turnover could causeunwanted volatility  The Company has experienced significant turnover in Board and Management positions during the past several years. TheCompany seeks to mitigate the impacts of turnover by establishing minimum requirements for each position and through its interview processes. While the Company believes that it has retained experienced and qualified replacements, interruptions inthe development and execution of the Companys business plans, lack of familiarity with the design and execution of surrounding internal control systems, and the familiarity with the Companys operations might cause the Company toexperience problems in these areas which could result in adverse effects for Alico. Furthermore, the Companys accounting department is small. The loss of any two key employees in close time proximity to each other could result in a possiblecompromise of the internal control systems or the ability to accurately report financial results in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Furthermore, Alicos rural location adds an additional challenge for recruitingand retaining qualified personnel. The Company attempts to hire qualified personnel, provide competitive compensation and benefit programs and a pleasant working environment to offset this risk. Agricultural Risks  General  Agricultural operations generate a large portion of Alicos revenues. Agriculture operations are subject to a wide variety of risks including product pricing due to variations in supply and demand,weather, disease, input costs and product liability.  Agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing whichis not predictable.  Because Alicos agricultural products are commodities, Alico is not able to predict with certainty what price itwill receive for its products; however, its costs are relatively fixed and the growth cycle of such products in many instances dictates when such products must be marketed which may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessivesupplies tend to cause severe price competition and lower prices throughout the industry affected. Conversely, shortages may cause higher prices. Shortages often result from adverse growing conditions which can reduce the available product ofgrowers in affected growing areas while not affecting others in non-affected growing areas. Alico attempts to mitigate these risks by forward pricing mechanisms and contracts. Alico cannot accurately predict or control from year to year what itsprofits or losses from agricultural operations will be.   8 Table of ContentsAlicos agricultural assets are concentrated and the effects of adverse weatherconditions such as hurricanes can be magnified.  Alicos agricultural operations are concentrated in south Florida counties with morethan 80% of its agricultural lands located in a contiguous parcel in Hendry County. All of these areas are subject to occasional periods of drought, excess rain, flooding, and freeze. Crops require water in different quantities at different timesduring the growth cycle. Accordingly, too much or too little water at any given point can adversely impact production. While Alico attempts to mitigate controllable weather risks through water management and crop selection, its ability to do so islimited. Alicos operations in southern and central Florida are also subject to the risk of hurricanes. Hurricanes have the potential to destroy crops, affect cattle breeding and impact citrus production through the loss of fruit anddestruction of trees either as a result of high winds or through the spread of wind blown disease. Alico was impacted by hurricanes during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 and sustained losses relating to the storms during all three of those fiscalyears. Alico seeks to minimize hurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but a portion of Alicos crops remain uninsured. Because Alicos agricultural properties are located in relative close proximity to each other, theimpact of adverse weather conditions may be magnified in Alicos results of operations.  Alicos agriculturalearnings comprise a major portion of its revenues and are subject to wide volatility which could result in breaches of loan covenants. Borrowing capacity represents a major source of Alicos working capital. Alico currently has a Revolving Line of Credit (RLOC) and a Term Loan withRabobank, N.A. Both of these loans contain covenants requiring the Company to maintain a minimum current ratio of 2.0:1, a debt ratio no greater than 60%, tangible stockholder equity of at least $80 million, and a minimum debt coverage ratio of1.15:1. While Alico currently expects to remain within these covenants, because of the volatility of its earnings stream and the factors causing this volatility, Alico is unable in some instances, to directly control compliance with these covenants.In March 2010, Alico received a one time waiver of the debt coverage ratio requirement from its previous lender, Farm Credit of Southwest Florida, in response to a freeze which damaged crops and affected the timing of their harvest. The Companybelieves that, based on factors currently known, it will continue to remain in compliance with its covenants for the next several years. The Company has recently negotiated a relaxed debt coverage ratio covenant to provide that the covenant must bebreached in two consecutive years in order to be considered an event of default. Nevertheless, due to earnings volatility and factors unknown to the Company at this time, it is possible that a loan covenant could be breached, a default occur, andthe major portion of the Companys borrowings become due which could have a material adverse impact on Alicos results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Water Use Regulation restricts Alicos access to water for agricultural use. Alicos agricultural operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface and underground water needed to produce its crops. Theavailability of water for use in irrigation is regulated by the State of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction over various geographic regions in which Alicos lands are located. Currently, Alico has permits for theuse of underground and surface water which are adequate for its agricultural needs. Surface water in Hendry County, where much of Alicos agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobee via the Caloosahatchee River and the system ofcanals used to irrigate such land. The Army Corps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee and ultimately determines the availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the State of Florida through thewater management district. Recently the Army Corps of Engineers decided to lower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of the levees surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result fromhurricanes. Changes in permitting for underground or surface water use during times of drought, because of lower lake levels, may result in shortages of water for agricultural use by Alico and could have a materially adverse effect on Alicosagricultural operations and financial results.   9 Table of ContentsAlicos citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from disease including but notlimited to Citrus Canker and Citrus Greening diseases.  Alicos citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such asCitrus Canker and Citrus Greening. Each of these diseases is widespread in Florida and Alico has found instances of Citrus Canker and/or Citrus Greening in several of its groves. Both diseases exist in areas where Company groves are located. Thereis no known cure for Citrus Canker at the present time although some pesticides inhibit the development of the disease. The disease is spread by contact with infected trees or by wind blown transmission. Alicos policy is to destroy trees whichbecome infected with this disease or with Citrus Greening disease. Alico maintains an inspection program to discover infestations early and utilizes best management practices to attempt to control diseases and their dissemination. Citrus Greeningdestroys infected trees and is spread by psyllids. Alico utilizes a pesticide program to control these hosts. At the present time, there is no known pesticide or other treatment for Citrus Greening once trees are infected. Both of these diseasespose a significant threat to the Florida Citrus industry and to Alicos citrus groves. Wide spread dissemination of these diseases in Alicos groves could cause a material adverse effect to Alicos operating results and citrus groveassets.  Pesticide and herbicide use by Alico or its lessees could create liability for Alico. Alico and some of the parties to whom Alico leases land for agricultural purposes, use herbicides, pesticides and other hazardous substances in theoperation of their businesses. All pesticides and herbicides used by Alico have been approved for use by the proper governmental agencies with the hazards attributable to each substance appropriately labeled and described. Alico maintains policiesrequiring its employees to apply such chemicals strictly in accordance with the labeling. As a term of its leasing agreements, Alico requires that third parties also adhere to proper handling and disposal of such materials; however, Alico does nothave full knowledge or control over the chemicals used by third parties who lease Alicos lands for cultivation. It is possible that some of these herbicides and pesticides could be harmful to humans if used improperly, or that there may beunknown hazards associated with such chemicals despite any contrary government or manufacturer labels. Alico might have to pay the costs or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuse of such substances.Which could have a materially adverse affect to Alico.  Changes in immigration laws or enforcement of such laws couldimpact the ability of Alico to harvest its crops.  Alico engages third parties to provide personnel for its harvesting operations. Alicocommunicates to such third parties its policy of employing only workers approved to work in the United States. However, Alico does not specifically monitor such compliance and the personnel engaged by such third parties could be from pools composedof immigrant labor. The availability and number of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws or by stricter enforcement of such laws. The scarcity of available personnel to harvest Alicosagricultural products could cause Alicos harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss of product that is not timely harvested which could have a materially adverse effect upon Alico. Changing public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks of Alicos agricultural products can affect demand andpricing of such products.  The general publics perception regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particularfood crops Alico grows and sells could reduce demand and prices for some of Alicos products. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products Alico produces for health or other reasons, and Alico is unable to modify itsproducts or to develop products that satisfy new customer preferences, there could be decreased demand for Alicos products. Even if market prices are unfavorable, produce items which are ready to be or have been harvested must be brought tomarket. Additionally, Alico has significant investments in its citrus groves and cannot easily shift to alternative products for this land. A decrease in the selling price received for Alicos products due to the factors described above couldhave a materially adverse effect on Alico.   10 Table of ContentsAlico faces significant competition in its agricultural operations. Alico faces significant competition in its agricultural operations both from domestic and foreign producers and does not have any branded products.Foreign growers generally have a lower cost of production, less environmental regulation and in some instances greater resources and market flexibility than Alico. Because foreign growers have great flexibility as to when they enter the U.S. market,Alico cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on its business and results of operations. The competition Alico faces from foreign suppliers of sugar and orange juice is mitigated by quota restriction on sugar imports imposed bythe U.S. government and by a governmentally imposed tariff on U.S. orange imports. A change in the governments sugar policy allowing more imports or a reduction in the U.S. orange juice tariff could adversely impact Alicos results ofoperations.   "

A complete listing of risks is beyondthe scope of this document. However, in contemplating the financial position and results ofoperations of Alico, investors should carefully consider, among other factors, the following riskfactors:GeneralAlico has a 51% stockholder and a limited public float which could adversely affect the price ofits stock and restrict the ability of the minority shareholders to have a voice in corporategovernance.Atlantic Blue Group, Inc. (Atlanticblue) (formerly Atlantic Blue Trust, Inc.) is the owner ofapproximately 51% of Alicos common stock. Accordingly, Alicos common stock is thinly traded andits market price may fluctuate significantly more than stocks with a larger public float.Additionally by virtue of its ownership percentage, Atlanticblue is able to elect all directorsand, consequently, is deemed to control Alico. While Atlanticblue has issued a governance letterdated December 3, 2009 reaffirming its commitment to maintaining a majority of independentdirectors on Alicos Board of Directors, this commitment may be terminated at any time upon 30 daysprior written notice.

Additionally, changes from time to time in anyor a combination of these factors could result in delays in sales, Alicos ability to sell tractswhich are determined to be surplus or its ability to realize optimum pricing from such sales.Alico carries large receivables from seller-financed sales of large tracts of surplus land thecollectability of which is subject to credit risk relating to debtors.The Companys sale of surplus lands often involves buyer financing provided by the Company. Inaddition to the cash deposit paid by a buyer of surplus land, the Company at times takes a mortgagefor the unpaid balance of the purchase price of the land sales contract. The collectability of theamounts owed is dependent on the creditworthiness of the mortgagors, which often depends upontheir continued financial success. The purchasers of the surplus tracts are often developers, whosesuccess is in turn directly affected by multiple factors in the national and local real estatemarkets, including but not limited to interest rates, demand for housing, competition from otheravailable land, governmental regulation, permitting, and unanticipated costs of construction.Depending on the magnitude of its debt to the Company, a mortgagors default on a sales contract orthe bankruptcy of any material purchaser of surplus land could have a materially adverse effect onthe Company. Additionally, if a borrower defaults on a secured property and the Company repossessesthe property, the Company cannot predict, under the current real estate market conditions, if therepossessed property can be sold in the near term or, if the Company is able to sell therepossessed property, if such sale will result in a gain equal to the anticipated gain under theoriginal sales contract for such property. Currently Alico-Agri is foreclosing on a mortgage on atract involving 4,528 acres in Lee County, Florida with an outstanding balance of $52.2 million.This foreclosure is being contested. If Alico-Agri is successful in foreclosing on this tract, itdoes not believe that it will be able to obtain a deficiency judgment for the amount owed, whichmay be in excess of the value of the foreclosed property at the time of foreclosure.Alico is subject to environmental liability by virtue of owning significant holdings of real estateassets.Alico faces a potential for environmental liability by virtue of its ownership of real property. Ifhazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by Alico or by any persons leasingAlicos lands) are discovered on or emanating from any of Alicos lands and the release of suchsubstances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, Alico may be heldstrictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition,environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the sites location,its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangeredspecies on the site. Although Alico purchases insurance when it is available for environmentalliability, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may notcontinue to be available to Alico at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possiblethat in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of aparticular tract of land or be significant enough that it would have a materially adverse effect onAlico.Alico has a large customer that accounts for 24% of revenues.For thefiscal year ended September 30, 2009, Alicos largestcustomer, U.S. Sugar Corporation (USSC) for whomAlico grows sugarcane, accounted for approximately24% of operating revenue. Additionally, Alico sells citrus to Southern Gardens, a wholly owned subsidiary ofUSSC. These marketing arrangements involve marketing pools which allow the contracting party tomarket Alicos product in conjunction with the product of other entities in the pool and pay Alicoa proportionate share of the resulting revenue from the sale of the entire pooled product. WhileAlico believes that it can replace these arrangements with other marketing alternatives, it may notbe able to do so quickly and the results may not be as favorable as the current contracts. 9Table of ContentsAgricultural Risks  GeneralAgricultural operations generate a large portion of Alicos revenues.

Because foreign growers have great flexibility as to when they enter theU.S. market, Alico cannot always predict the impact these competitors will have on its business andresults of operations. The competition Alico faces from foreign suppliers of sugar and orange juiceis mitigated by quota restriction on sugar imports imposed by the U.S. government and by agovernmentally imposed tariff on U.S. orange imports. A change in the governments sugar policyallowing more imports or a reduction in the U.S. orange juice tariff would adversely impact Alicosresults of operations"

.Alicos operations involve varying degrees of risk and each investor should consider the specificrisks and speculative features inherent in and affecting the business of Alico before investing inAlico. In considering the following risk and speculative factors, an investor should realize thatthere is a possibility of losing his or her entire investment.Alicos financial condition and results of operations could be affected by the risk factorsdiscussed below. These factors may also cause actual results to differ materially from the resultscontemplated by the forward looking statements in Managements Discussion and Analysis.The list of risks below is not intended to be all inclusive. A complete listing of risks is beyondthe scope of this document. However, in contemplating the financial position and results ofoperations of Alico, investors should carefully consider, among other factors, the following riskfactors:GeneralAlico has a 51% stockholder and a limited public float which could adversely affect the price ofits stock and restrict the ability of the minority shareholders to have a voice in corporategovernance.AtlanticBlue Group, Inc. (AtlanticBlue) (formerly Atlantic Blue Trust, Inc.) is the owner ofapproximately 51% of Alicos common stock. Accordingly, Alicos common stock is thinly traded andits market price may fluctuate significantly more than stocks with a larger public float.Additionally by virtue of its ownership percentage, AtlanticBlue is able to elect all directorsand, consequently, is deemed to control Alico. While AtlanticBlue has issued a governance letterdated September 29, 2006 reaffirming its commitment to maintaining a majority of independentdirectors on Alicos Board of Directors, this commitment may be terminated at any time upon 30 daysprior written notice. Alico does not have cumulative voting. Accordingly, stockholders of Alicoother than AtlanticBlue have no effective control over who the management and directors of Alicoare or will be.Alico manages its properties in an attempt to capture its highest and best use and customarily doesnot sell property until it determines that the property is surplus to its agricultural activitiesby reason of its potential for industrial, commercial or residential use. Alico has little controlover when this occurs as real estate sales are primarily market driven.Alicos goal for its land management program is to manage and selectively improve its lands fortheir most profitable use. To this end, Alico continually evaluates its properties focusing on soilcapabilities, subsurface composition, topography, transportation, availability of markets for itscrops and the climatic characteristics of each of the tracts. While Alico is primarily engaged inagricultural activities, when land is determined to be better suited to industrial, commercial orresidential use, Alico has classified the property as surplus to its agricultural activities andsold it. Alicos land management strategy is thus a long term strategy to acquire, hold and manageland for its best use, selling surplus land at opportune times and in a manner that would maximizeAlicos profits from such surplus tracts. The timing for when agricultural lands become bestsuited for industrial, commercial or residential use depends upon a number of factors which arebeyond the control of Alico such as:  population migration;    national, regional and local economic conditions; 10Table of Contents  conditions in local real estate markets (e.g., supply of land versus demand);    competition from other available property;    current level of, or potential availability of roads and utilities;    availability of governmental entitlements;    government regulation and changes in real estate, zoning, land use,environmental or tax laws;    interest rates and the availability of financing, and;    potential liability under environmental and other laws.Alico is not able to predict when its properties will become best suited for non-agricultural useand has limited ability to influence this process. Additionally, changes from time to time in anyor a combination of these factors could result in delays in sales, Alicos ability to sell tractswhich are determined to be surplus or its ability to realize optimum pricing from such sales.Alico carries large receivables from seller-financed sales of large tracts of surplus land thecollectibility of which is subject to credit risk relating to debtors.The Companys sale of surplus lands often involves buyer financing provided by the Company. Inaddition to the cash deposit paid by a buyer of surplus land, the Company at times takes a mortgagefor the unpaid balance of the purchase price of the land sales contract. The collectability of theamounts owed and the likelihood that the Company will achieve the profitability promised by anysales contract is dependent on the creditworthiness of the mortgagors, which often depends upontheir continued financial success. The purchasers of the surplus tracts are often developers, whosesuccess is in turn directly affected by multiple factors in the national and local real estatemarkets, including but not limited to interest rates, demand for housing, competition from otheravailable land, governmental regulation, permitting, and unanticipated costs of construction. Depending on the magnitude of its debt tothe Company, a mortgagors default on a sales contract or the bankruptcy of any material purchaserof surplus land could have a materially adverse effect on the Company. Additionally, if a borrowerdefaults on a secured property and the Company repossesses the property, the Company cannotpredict, under the current real estate market conditions, if the repossessed property can be soldin the near term or, if the Company is able to sell the repossessed property, if such sale willresult in a gain equal to the anticipated gain under the original sales contract for such property. 11Table of ContentsAlico is subject to environmental liability by virtue of owning significant holdings of real estateassets.Alico faces a potential for environmental liability by virtue of its ownership of real property. Ifhazardous substances (including herbicides and pesticides used by Alico or by any persons leasingAlicos lands) are discovered on or emanating from any of Alicos lands and the releaseof such substances presents a threat of harm to the public health or the environment, Alico may beheld strictly liable for the cost of remediation of these hazardous substances. In addition,environmental laws that apply to a given site can vary greatly according to the sites location,its present and former uses, and other factors such as the presence of wetlands or endangeredspecies on the site. Although Alico purchases insurance when it is available for environmentalliability, these insurance contracts may not be adequate to cover such costs or damages or may notcontinue to be available to Alico at prices and terms that would be satisfactory. It is possiblethat in some cases the cost of compliance with these environmental laws could exceed the value of aparticular tract of land or be significant enough that it would have a materially adverse effect onAlico.Alico has a large customer that accounts for 21% of revenues.For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2008, Alicos largest customer accounted for approximately21% of operating revenue. Alicos largest customer is U.S. Sugar Corporation (USSC), for whom Alicogrows sugarcane. Additionally, Alico sells citrus to Southern Gardens, a wholly ownedsubsidiary of USSC. These marketing arrangements involve marketing pools which allow thecontracting party to market Alicos product in conjunction with the product of other entities inthe pool and pay Alico a proportionate share of the resulting revenue from the sale of the entirepooled product. While Alico believes that it can replace these arrangements with other marketingalternatives, it may not be able to do so quickly and the results may not be as favorable as thecurrent contracts.Florida Governor Charlie Crist has announced that the South Florida Water Management District(SFWMD) is negotiating a purchase of the land holdings of USSC. Under the terms of the most recentproposal, USSC will retain ownership and continue operation of its sugar mill, sugar refinery andcitrus plant. USSC would lease back the property sold to SFWMD for a period of seven crop cycles.At the present time, Alico is unable to assess the impact of this potential transaction on itsoperations. As the potential sale progresses and more details become known, Alico will continue toassess its options and strategies going forward.Agricultural Risks  GeneralAgricultural operations generate a large portion of Alicos revenues. Agriculture operations aresubject to a wide variety of risks including product pricing due to variations in supply anddemand, weather, disease, input costs and product liability.Agricultural products are subject to supply and demand pricing which is not predictable.Because Alicos agricultural products are commodities, Alico is not able to predict with certaintywhat price it will receive for its products; however, its costs are relatively fixed. Additionally,the growth cycle of such products in many instances dictates when such products must be marketedwhich may or may not be advantageous in obtaining the best price. Excessive supplies tend to causesevere price competition and lower prices throughout the industry affected. Conversely, shortagesmay cause higher prices. Shortages often result from adverse growing conditions which canreduce the available product of growers in affected growing areas while not affecting others in non-affectedgrowing areas. Since multiple variables which can affect pricing are incurred before pricing andsupply are known, Alico cannot accurately predict or control from year to year what its profits orlosses from agricultural operations will be. 12Table of ContentsAlicos agricultural assets are concentrated and the effects of adverse weather conditions such ashurricanes can be magnified.Alicos agricultural operations are concentrated in south Florida counties with more than 80% ofits agricultural lands located in a contiguous parcel in Hendry County. All of these areas aresubject to occasional periods of drought, excess rain, flooding, and freeze. Crops require water indifferent quantities at different times during the growth cycle. Accordingly, too much or toolittle water at any given point can adversely impact production. While Alico attempts to mitigatecontrollable weather risks through water management and crop selection, its ability to do so islimited. Alicos operations in southern and central Florida are also subject to the risk ofhurricanes. Hurricanes have the potential to destroy crops and impact citrus production through theloss of fruit and destruction of trees either as a result of high winds or through the spread ofwind blown disease. Alico was impacted by hurricanes during fiscal years 2006, 2005 and 2004 andsustained losses relating to the storms during all three fiscal years. Alico seeks to minimizehurricane risk by the purchase of insurance contracts, but a portion of Alicos crops remainuninsured. Because Alicos agricultural properties are located in relative close proximity to eachother, the impact of adverse weather conditions may be magnified in Alicos results of operations.Water Use Regulation restricts Alicos access to water for agricultural use.Alicos agricultural operations are dependent upon the availability of adequate surface andunderground water needed to produce its crops. The availability of water for use in irrigation isregulated by the State of Florida through water management districts which have jurisdiction overvarious geographic regions in which Alicos lands are located. Currently, Alico has permits for theuse of underground and surface water which are adequate for its agricultural needs. Surface waterin Hendry County, where much of Alicos agricultural land is located, comes from Lake Okeechobeevia the Caloosahatchee River and the system of canals used to irrigate such land. Since the ArmyCorps of Engineers controls the level of Lake Okeechobee, this organization ultimately determinesthe availability of surface water even though the use of water has been permitted by the State ofFlorida through the water management district. Recently the Army Corps of Engineers decided tolower the permissible level of Lake Okeechobee in response to concerns about the ability of thelevees surrounding the lake to restrain rising waters which could result from hurricanes. Changesin permitting for underground or surface water use during times of drought, because of lower lakelevels, may result in shortages of water for agricultural use by Alico and could have a materiallyadverse effect on Alicos agricultural operations and financial results.Alicos citrus groves aresubject to damage and loss from disease including but not limited toCitrus Canker and Citrus Greening diseases.Alicos citrus groves are subject to damage and loss from diseases such as Citrus Canker and CitrusGreening. Each of these diseases are widespread in Florida and Alico has found instances of CitrusCanker and/or Citrus Greening in several of its groves. Both diseases are present in areas whereCompany groves are located. There is no known cure for Citrus Canker at the present time althoughsome pesticides inhibit the development of the disease. The disease is spread by contact withinfected trees or by wind blown transmission. Alicos policy is to destroy trees which becomeinfected with this disease or with Citrus Greening disease. Alico maintains an inspection programto discover infestations early. Citrus Greening destroys infected trees and is spread by psyllids.Alico utilizes a pesticide program to control these hosts. There is no known pesticide or othertreatment for Citrus Greening once trees are infected at the present time. Both of these diseasespose a significant threat to the Florida Citrus industry and to Alicos citrusgroves. Wide spread dissemination of these diseases in Alicos groves could cause a materialadverse effect to Alicos operating results and citrus grove assets. 13Table of ContentsPesticide and herbicide use by Alico or its lessees could create liability for Alico.Alico and some of the parties to whom Alico leases land for agricultural purposes, use herbicides,pesticides and other hazardous substances in the operation of their businesses. All pesticides andherbicides used by Alico have been approved for use by the proper governmental agencies with thehazards attributable to each substance appropriately labeled and described. Alico maintainspolicies requiring its employees to apply such chemicals strictly in accordance with the labeling.However, Alico does not have any knowledge or control over the chemicals used by third parties wholease Alicos lands for cultivation. It is possible that some of these herbicides and pesticidescould be harmful to humans if used improperly, or that there may be unknown hazards associated withsuch chemicals despite any contrary government or manufacturer labels. Alico might have to pay thecosts or damages associated with the improper application, accidental release or the use or misuseof such substances.Changes in immigration laws or enforcement of such laws could impact the ability of Alico toharvest its crops.Alico engages third parties to provide personnel for its harvesting operations. The personnelengaged by such companies could be from pools composed of immigrant labor. The availability andnumber of such workers is subject to decrease if there are changes in the U.S. immigration laws orby stricter enforcement of such laws. The scarcity of available personnel to harvest Alicosagricultural products could cause Alicos harvesting costs to increase or could lead to the loss ofproduct that is not timely harvested which could have a materially adverse effect upon Alico.Changing public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks of Alicos agriculturalproducts can affect demand and pricing of such products.The general publics perception regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated withparticular food crops Alico grows and sells could reduce demand and prices for some of Alicosproducts. To the extent that consumer preferences evolve away from products Alico produces forhealth or other reasons, and Alico is unable to modify its products or to develop products thatsatisfy new customer preferences, there could be decreased demand for Alicos products. Even ifmarket prices are unfavorable, produce items which are ready to be or have been harvested must bebrought to market. Additionally, Alico has significant investments in its citrus groves and cannoteasily shift to alternative products for this land. A decrease in the selling price received forAlicos products due to the factors described above could have a materially adverse effect onAlico. 14Table of ContentsAlico faces significant competition in its agricultural operations.Alico faces significant competition in its agricultural operations both from domestic and foreignproducers and does not have any branded products.

A complete listing of risks is beyondthe scope of this document. However, in contemplating the financial position and results ofoperations of the Company, investors should carefully consider, among other factors, the followingrisk factors:GeneralThe Company has not fully settled its appeal with the IRS.The Company has been in negotiations with IRS Appeals regarding a thirty day letter issued by theIRS pertaining to audits of Alico and its Agri Insurance subsidiary for the tax years 2000 through2004. As a result of the negotiations, the Company has paid a total of $66.2 million, representing$41.4 million of additional taxes, $20.7 million of interest, and $4.1 million of penalties. TheCompany does not believe that any additional payments will be required to settle the matter withthe IRS and has submitted a closing agreement to IRS Appeals; however, IRS Appeals has not yetexecuted the closing agreement and could take a position requiring the Company to remit additionalfunds. 9Table of ContentsThe Company has a 50.5% stockholder and a limited public float which could adversely affect theprice of its stock and restrict the ability of the minority shareholders to have a voice incorporate governance.Atlantic Blue Group, Inc.
