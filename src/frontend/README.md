# React Application: Risk Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a Risk Analysis Dashboard built with React. It provides functionalities for visualizing knowledge graphs, displaying risk filings, and navigating through different sections of the application via a navbar. The application uses various React components to deliver a cohesive and interactive user experience.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Structure

- `App.jsx`: The main application component that sets up the routes and renders the primary layout.
- `KnowledgeGraph.jsx`: Component for displaying a knowledge graph based on risk analysis data.
- `Navbar.jsx`: Component for the navigation bar that allows users to navigate through different sections of the application.
- `RiskFilings.jsx`: Component for displaying risk filings related to various companies.
- `Router.jsx`: Component that manages the routing for different pages in the application.
- `TickerPage.jsx`: Component for displaying detailed information about a specific company's ticker.

## Components

### `App.jsx`

The main entry point of the application. It sets up the router and renders the `Navbar` and other primary components based on the current route.

### `KnowledgeGraph.jsx`

This component is responsible for rendering a knowledge graph visualization. It displays relationships between different entities based on risk analysis data.

### `Navbar.jsx`

The navigation bar component. It provides links to different sections of the application such as the knowledge graph, risk filings, and ticker pages.

### `RiskFilings.jsx`

Displays a list of risk filings related to various companies. This component fetches and shows detailed risk information that users can browse.

### `Router.jsx`

Manages routing within the application. It defines the routes for different pages and renders the appropriate components based on the current URL.
